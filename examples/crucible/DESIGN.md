# Crucible: design

*Working slug. The game gets a title, a fiction and art only in Phase 5
(GUIDE.md). Until then this document describes rules, not worlds.*

## 0. Method

Built the way `GUIDE.md` prescribes, phase by phase:

| Phase | Question | Exit |
|---|---|---|
| 0 Toys | Which generative rule is worth a game? | 3+ grey-box toys, one kept, the reason recorded here |
| 1 Grey box | Is poking the kept rule fun in plain text? | GUIDE.md Phase 1 checklist |
| 2 Overloading | Does one input carry several pressures? | Phase 2 checklist |
| 3 Matrix | Do operators and properties combine by laws? | Phase 3 checklist |
| 4 Pacing | Do scenes teach, twist and pay off? | Phase 4 checklist |
| 5 Wrapping | Do look and words follow the systems? | Phase 5 checklist |

Three rules hold throughout: language decides and a ledger accounts; reuse
Concordia before writing; game code here, reusable code in
`concordia/contrib/`.

## 1. The constraint on the core rule

The core rule must need a language model: language input, or entities driven
by language models, must change outcomes in ways a lookup table could not.
Every toy therefore splits in two:

- **The judgement** a language model makes about meaning (does this claim
  contradict that one? how does this party hear this sentence?).
- **The consequence**, applied by deterministic code from that judgement,
  with every number in `data/*.yaml`.

Each toy's mock (`toys/<toy>/mock.py`) is the lookup-table floor of its
judgement: what the rule becomes without a language model. It makes CI, bots
and balance sweeps reproducible. The gap between the mock and a real model
is part of what each toy is judged on.

## 2. The toys (Phase 0)

### Toy A: claims (built, cycle 1)

**Rule.** Two sides share a board of short claims. A move adds one claim of
at most 12 words. A language model reads the new claim against every
standing claim: supports, contradicts, says the same, or unrelated. Then
deterministic argument physics settles the board:

    w(i) = clamp(base(i) + gain * sum agree w - drag * sum conflict w, 0, cap)

iterated to a fixed point. A claim below the line falls, permanently, and the
board settles again: each round of falls is one beat of a cascade. New claims
start below the line (base 0.3 < 0.35), so a claim stands only while
something standing supports it. Theses and the board's starting facts stand
on their own.

**Why it is generative.** Wording decides which claims a move touches, so a
small change in phrasing changes which claims fall and which neighbours
follow them. A claim that many others lean on is a load-bearing wall: cut it
and the structure comes down in beats.

**Costs.** Ink (40 words a side), moves (6 a side), and the risk that a claim
contradicts your own side too. A restatement adds no new claim; it firms the
restated one a little (+0.1 base, up to 1.5).

**Playtest notes (cycle 1, MOCK).**

1. YAML read `no`, `false`, `on`, `true` as booleans, so the lexicon missed
   negations; quoted.
2. With the multiplicative tug-of-war physics, the first move won every game:
   two symmetric clusters are an unstable equilibrium. Switched to additive
   support with small coefficients and claims that need support to stand.
3. Echoing a supporting claim was a dominant strategy; restatements now fold
   into the claim they restate.
4. Now: the skilled bot wins 100% against the mock rival, random and passive
   play 0%; the median turn offers 3 moves that measurably change the board.
   The decisive move is a cascade: one claim felled four.

### Toy B: relay (planned, cycle 2)

The player is the go-between for two parties driven by language models. Each
message passes through the player, who may change a limited number of words
before it is delivered. Each party's hidden ledger (what it wants, what it
will accept, how much it trusts the go-between) decides its replies; a
language model decides how a reworded message lands. Audits compare what was
said with what was delivered.

### Toy C: orders (planned, cycle 3)

The player writes one standing order of at most 12 words for a crew of
entities with different temperaments. Each tick, each crew member's language
model reads the order against its own situation and picks an action from a
fixed menu; a ledger applies the actions to supplies, hazards and tasks. One
order has to hold up across situations nobody listed.

## 3. Prior art (cycle 1 search)

| Work | What it does | How the toys differ |
|---|---|---|
| Hearsay, Sindome's rumour system, The Mill | NPCs retell rumours with language models; believed rumours come true | Toy A has no NPC gossip: claims interact through judged relations and a weighted argument graph |
| IF:CARGO (arXiv 2608.12195) | Natural-language IF/THEN rules compiled to a command schema | Toy C keeps the order as language and lets each entity reinterpret it per situation |
| "Wargame agents" (seangoedecke.com) | Text orders to generals, no direct control | Toy C is a single standing order against a ledger, judged by robustness across situations |
| Minister Plenipotentiary | Diplomatic negotiation | Toy B's player is not a party; the move is rewording someone else's message |
| Abstract argumentation (Dung; weighted and bipolar semantics) | Formal acceptability of arguments | Toy A uses weighted bipolar semantics as game physics, with relations judged by a language model from free text |

## 4. Concordia mapping

| Need | Concordia piece |
|---|---|
| Running a game | `prefabs/simulation/generic.Simulation`, `Sequential` engine |
| Game master | `switch_act.SwitchAct` with the well-known keys (`gm.py`): `terminate.Terminate`, `make_observation.MakeObservation` on an `ObservationQueue` (no LLM fallback), toy-driven turn order, action specs and resolution |
| Entities | `minimal.Entity`, subclassed only to read its act component factory from params (`prefabs.py`) |
| The player's seat | `HumanActComponent`; bots are `HumanInput` readers (`seats.py`), so people and bots play through one path |
| Model-played sides | `ConcatActComponent` (the minimal entity's default) |
| Models | contrib `language_model_setup` (Ollama, Together), `RetryLanguageModel`, `CallLimitLanguageModel` |
| Logs | `SimulationLog.to_html` in each run folder |

## 5. Decisions

| Cycle | Decision |
|---|---|
| 1 | Slug `crucible`; toys share one harness and one generic game master. |
| 1 | Bots sit in the human seat as `HumanInput` readers instead of a new act component. |
| 1 | Claims physics: additive support, claims need support to stand, restatements fold. |
| 1 | In the sandbox the rival moves first. |
