    default_time_and_place_modules: A list of modules to choose from.

      random module from default_time_and_place_modules will be chosen.
    seed: The random seed to use for sampling the parameters.

  Returns:
    time_and_place_params: a module containing the settings for the time and
      place.
    sampled_settings: a dictionary of sampled settings for the selected setting,
      produced by calling time_and_place_params.sample_parameters(). The idea is
      that, while `time_and_place_params` contains the general settings like
      the date and location, `sampled_settings` contains the specific values
      like the names of individual characters, which must be resampled for each
      run of the simulation.
