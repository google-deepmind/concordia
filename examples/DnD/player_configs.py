Over time, you grew disillusioned with many of your fellow soldiers. They seemed to enjoy their authority at the expense of the people they’re supposed to protect.

Though you dismissed the dreams at first, you began to hear a voice calling you to stand against death’s endless hunger. Certain of your deity’s wishes, you resigned your post and set out on your quest.""",

A remote cloister there holds a temple to the dragon god Bahamut, who is a patron of heroes and a champion of justice. Someone at the cloister may hold the key to the impending doom your deity wishes you to avert.""",
