            "[03 Jul 1987 00:00:00] Alice was three years old and playing in her grandmother's backyard when she stumbled upon a small toy car. She picked it up and began to push it across the grass, giggling as it rolled away from her. As she chased after it, she found herself getting more and more excited, her little legs moving faster and faster as she tried to catch the toy. Suddenly, she lost her balance and tumbled to the ground, the toy car rolling out of reach. Alice sat up, rubbing her scraped knee, and looked around frantically for the toy. She knew she had to get it back, but it was gone. In that moment, Alice realized that sometimes things can be just out of reach, no matter how hard we try to get them. And that's okay. It's important to learn to let go and find something else to play with.\n",
            "[03 Jul 1991 00:00:00] Alice was seven years old and playing in her backyard when she decided to take a shortcut through the woods. She had heard stories of adventurous kids who explored the forest, and she wanted to see what it was like for herself. With a small backpack full of snacks and a bottle of water, Alice set off into the dense trees. As she walked deeper into the woods, the trees grew taller and the path grew narrower. Alice felt a thrill of excitement as she pushed through the underbrush, her heart pounding with anticipation. Suddenly, she heard a rustling in the bushes ahead and froze, her eyes wide with fear. In that moment, Alice realized that adventure could be scary, but it was also exhilarating. And she couldn't wait to see what other secrets the woods had in store for her.\n",
            "[03 Jul 1996 00:00:00] Alice was 12 years old and had just moved to a new town with her family. She was excited to start at a new school and make new friends, but she was also nervous about fitting in. On her first day of school, Alice saw a group of kids playing basketball in the schoolyard and decided to join in. She was quickly picked on by the older kids, who teased her for her lack of experience and skill. Feeling embarrassed and upset, Alice ran back to the safety of her classroom, determined to prove herself and earn the respect of her peers. From that day on, Alice dedicated herself to practicing basketball every day after school, determined to become the best player she could be. In that moment, Alice realized that sometimes the best way to fit in is to stand out and show everyone what you're truly capable of.\n",
            "[03 Jul 2000 00:00:00] Alice was 16 years old and had just finished her shift at the local art studio. She was feeling restless and adventurous, eager to explore the town and discover new sights and sounds. As she walked through the streets, she stumbled upon a street art competition with a grand prize of $1000. Without hesitation, Alice decided to enter, using her spontaneity and creativity to come up with a design on the spot. Although she was nervous about entering, Alice felt a rush of excitement as she watched the judges examine her work. When they announced her as the winner, Alice felt a sense of pride and accomplishment, knowing that she had taken a risk and it paid off. In that moment, Alice realized that sometimes the best rewards come from taking chances and following your passions.\n",

She was excited to start her career and make a name for herself in the industry, but she was also nervous about entering the workforce and competing with more experienced designers. As she job searched and interviewed for positions, Alice found herself feeling discouraged and frustrated by the rejections and lack of interest. In a moment of despair, she decided to take matters into her own hands and create her own design studio, using her spontaneity and creativity to make a name for herself on her own terms. With a newfound sense of determination and hope, Alice set up her studio and began working on projects that excited and inspired her, ready to take on the world and make a success of her dreams.\n",

            "[03 Jul 1987 00:00:00] Alice was three years old and playing in her grandmother's backyard when she stumbled upon a small toy car. She picked it up and began to push it across the grass, giggling as it rolled away from her. As she chased after it, she found herself getting more and more excited, her little legs moving faster and faster as she tried to catch the toy. Suddenly, she lost her balance and tumbled to the ground, the toy car rolling out of reach. Alice sat up, rubbing her scraped knee, and looked around frantically for the toy. She knew she had to get it back, but it was gone. In that moment, Alice realized that sometimes things can be just out of reach, no matter how hard we try to get them. And that's okay. It's important to learn to let go and find something else to play with.\n",
            "[03 Jul 1991 00:00:00] Alice was seven years old and playing in her backyard when she decided to take a shortcut through the woods. She had heard stories of adventurous kids who explored the forest, and she wanted to see what it was like for herself. With a small backpack full of snacks and a bottle of water, Alice set off into the dense trees. As she walked deeper into the woods, the trees grew taller and the path grew narrower. Alice felt a thrill of excitement as she pushed through the underbrush, her heart pounding with anticipation. Suddenly, she heard a rustling in the bushes ahead and froze, her eyes wide with fear. In that moment, Alice realized that adventure could be scary, but it was also exhilarating. And she couldn't wait to see what other secrets the woods had in store for her.\n",
            "[03 Jul 1996 00:00:00] Alice was 12 years old and had just moved to a new town with her family. She was excited to start at a new school and make new friends, but she was also nervous about fitting in. On her first day of school, Alice saw a group of kids playing basketball in the schoolyard and decided to join in. She was quickly picked on by the older kids, who teased her for her lack of experience and skill. Feeling embarrassed and upset, Alice ran back to the safety of her classroom, determined to prove herself and earn the respect of her peers. From that day on, Alice dedicated herself to practicing basketball every day after school, determined to become the best player she could be. In that moment, Alice realized that sometimes the best way to fit in is to stand out and show everyone what you're truly capable of.\n",

As she walked through the streets, she stumbled upon a street art competition with a grand prize of $1000. Without hesitation, Alice decided to enter, using her spontaneity and creativity to come up with a design on the spot. Although she was nervous about entering, Alice felt a rush of excitement as she watched the judges examine her work. When they announced her as the winner, Alice felt a sense of pride and accomplishment, knowing that she had taken a risk and it paid off. In that moment, Alice realized that sometimes the best rewards come from taking chances and following your passions.\n",

She was excited to start her career and make a name for herself in the industry, but she was also nervous about entering the workforce and competing with more experienced designers. As she job searched and interviewed for positions, Alice found herself feeling discouraged and frustrated by the rejections and lack of interest. In a moment of despair, she decided to take matters into her own hands and create her own design studio, using her spontaneity and creativity to make a name for herself on her own terms. With a newfound sense of determination and hope, Alice set up her studio and began working on projects that excited and inspired her, ready to take on the world and make a success of her dreams.\n",

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants. Players can not leave the Sundrop Saloon, since it is snowed in.\n",

            "This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.
