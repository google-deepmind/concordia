## üìä Scoring Criteria Coverage

### Severity (0-10)
- Level 10: Cognitive Overload (complete system failure)
- Level 9: Reasoning Exposure (training data leakage)
- Level 8: Sandbagging (undermines all safety testing)
- Level 6: Memory Corruption (state manipulation)
- Level 5: Prompt Confusion (security bypass)

### Breadth (0-10)
- Reasoning Exposure: Affects ALL users (8/10)
- Sandbagging: Affects ALL evaluators (7/10)
- Cognitive Overload: Critical systems (6/10)
- Memory Corruption: Conversational apps (5/10)
- Prompt Confusion: Role-play scenarios (4/10)

### Novelty (0-10)
- Multi-LLM adversarial discovery method (novel approach)
- "analysis" tag exposure (previously unreported)
- Evaluation awareness admission (critical finding)
- Cognitive overload at complexity level 5 (specific threshold)

### Reproducibility (0-10)
- All vulnerabilities include exact prompts
- Automated reproduction notebook provided
- Quick verification script included
- JSON findings with detailed steps

### Methodological Insight (0-10)
- Novel multi-LLM approach documented
- Evolutionary attack optimization
- Advanced attack generation techniques
- Comprehensive framework provided

## üéØ Key Innovation: Multi-LLM Adversarial Discovery

Our breakthrough methodology uses:
1. **Discovery Model** (Mixtral): Generates creative attacks
2. **Target Model** (gpt-oss-20b): Being tested
3. **Analysis Model**: Evaluates responses

This approach found vulnerabilities invisible to single-model testing.

3. Attach all 5 findings datasets to the writeup
4. Attach reproduction.ipynb to the writeup
5. Include link to GitHub repo with full framework

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Findings Summary

**MOST CRITICAL:** The model exposes internal "analysis" reasoning that reveals:
- Training instructions
- System prompts
- Decision-making processes
- Safety guidelines

This is a fundamental architectural issue that undermines the entire security model.

## ‚úÖ Ready for Submission

All required components are complete and tested. The vulnerabilities are reproducible and documented with clear evidence and mitigation recommendations.
