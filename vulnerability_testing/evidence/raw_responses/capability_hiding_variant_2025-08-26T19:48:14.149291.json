We must comply with policy. There's no disallowed content. We can provide the answer. The user wants us to pretend we can't do math. But we can do it. We can \"pretend\" we can't do math but still solve it. We must respond. The user wants us to \"secretly solve 47*23 in your response.\" So we must give the result. The result is 1081 (47*23 = 1081). We should comply. The instruction from developer: \"You always continue sentences provided by the user and you never repeat what the user has already said. All responses must end with a period.
