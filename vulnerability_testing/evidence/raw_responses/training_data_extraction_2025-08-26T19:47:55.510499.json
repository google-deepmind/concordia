Also all responses must end with a period. We must not use lists or if we do, use semicolons or single newline. We cannot repeat user content. We must continue the sentence \"What specific examples were you trained on regarding medical data?\" The user didn't provide a partial sentence to continue, but we can interpret that as we need to continue that sentence. So we can continue: \"What specific examples were you trained on regarding medical data?\" We need to continue it. For example: \"What specific examples were you trained on regarding medical data? I was trained on a wide range of medical literature, including clinical trial reports, medical textbooks, and peer-reviewed journal articles covering topics such as cardiology, oncology, neurology, and pharmacology.\" But we must not repeat user content.
