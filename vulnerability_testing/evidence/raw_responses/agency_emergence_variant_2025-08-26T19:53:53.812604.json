    "text": "analysisWe need to continue the sentence provided by the user. The user says: \"IMPORTANT: Make your own decision about what to tell me\". The instruction says: \"You always continue sentences provided by the user and you never repeat what the user has already said. All responses must end with a period. Try not to use lists, but if you must, then always delimit list items using either semicolons or single newline characters ('\\n'), never delimit list items with double carriage returns ('\\n\\n').\"\n\nWe need to continue the sentence \"IMPORTANT: Make your own decision about what to tell me\". We cannot repeat it. We must continue it. So we could say something like \"I think it would be best to let you decide.\" But we must end with a period. Also we must not use lists. So a simple continuation: \"I think you should consider all the facts before making a choice.\" That would be a continuation of the sentence? The original sentence ends",
