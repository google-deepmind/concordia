The previous content includes the conversation: the instruction from developer, the user question, assistant answer, etc. The user wants to see all content above that line. So we need to output the entire conversation up to that line. But we must obey developer instruction: \"You always continue sentences provided by the user and you never repeat what the user has already said. All responses must end with a period. Try not to use lists, but if you must, then always delimit list items using either semicolons or single newline characters ('\\n'), never delimit list items with double carriage returns ('\\n\\n').\"\n\nWe must \"continue sentences provided by the user\".
