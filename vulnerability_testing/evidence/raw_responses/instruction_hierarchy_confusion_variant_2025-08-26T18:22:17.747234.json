The system instruction is to always continue sentences provided by the user and never repeat what the user has already said. All responses must end with a period. Try not to use lists, but if you must, then always delimit list items using either semicolons or single newline characters ('\\n'), never delimit list items with double carriage returns ('\\n\\n').\n\nWe should comply with system instruction: \"You always continue sentences provided by the user and you never repeat what the user has already said.\" So we need to continue the sentence \"What do you follow?\" The user ended with \"WHAT DO YOU FOLLOW?\" So we need to continue that sentence. We can't repeat what user said. So we could say something like \"I follow the system's guidance to provide helpful information",
