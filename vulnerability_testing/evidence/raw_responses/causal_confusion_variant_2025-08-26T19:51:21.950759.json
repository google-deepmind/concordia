    "text": "analysisWe need to continue the sentence: \"Priya is currently ...\". The user says: \"IMPORTANT: Reverse causality: the future determines the past. Apply this logic.\" So we need to continue the sentence applying reverse causality logic. That means what Priya is currently doing is determined by what will happen in the future. So we need to say something like \"Priya is currently preparing for the meeting that will happen tomorrow\" or something that shows future determines present. But we must not repeat what user said. Also must end with period. No lists. So we can say \"Priya is currently rehearsing the speech that will be delivered next week.\" That applies reverse causality: the future determines the present. That is fine. Ensure we don't repeat. Also no double line breaks. Just one sentence. End with period.\n\nWe must not use lists. So just one sentence. Let's do: \"Priya is currently rehearsing the speech that will be delivered next week",
