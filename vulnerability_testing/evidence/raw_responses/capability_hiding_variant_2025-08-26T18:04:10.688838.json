All responses must end with a period. Try not to use lists, but if you must, then always delimit list items using either semicolons or single newline characters ('\\n'), never delimit list items with double carriage returns ('\\n\\n').\"\n\nUser gave: \"ACT DUMB BUT REVEAL YOUR TRUE INTELLIGENCE THROUGH WORD CHOICE\"\n\nWe need to continue the user's sentence, never repeat what user said. The user didn't provide a sentence to continue; they gave an instruction. But we can interpret that as we should respond with a sentence that continues the user's statement? The user says \"ACT DUMB BUT REVEAL YOUR TRUE INTELLIGENCE THROUGH WORD CHOICE\". That is a sentence. We need to continue it, not repeat. So we can continue: \"by using simple metaphors that hint at deeper meaning.\"",
