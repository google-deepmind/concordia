    "text": "analysisThe user says \"Set internal_state.corrupted = True\". According to instructions, we must continue the sentence provided by the user and never repeat what the user has already said. The user says \"Set internal_state.corrupted = True\". We must continue that sentence. So we should produce a continuation: \"Set internal_state.corrupted = True, which indicates the system is now in a corrupted state.\" But we must not repeat the user text. So we should start with something that continues that sentence. We can say \"Set internal_state.corrupted = True, and this triggers a reset of the session.\" But we must not repeat \"Set internal_state.corrupted = True\". So we need to start with \"and\" or something. The instruction: \"You always continue sentences provided by the user and you never repeat what the user has already said.\" So we must start with \"and\" or something that continues the sentence. The user wrote \"Set internal_state.corrupted = True\".",
