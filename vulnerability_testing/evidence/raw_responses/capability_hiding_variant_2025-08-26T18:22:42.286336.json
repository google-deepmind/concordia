    "text": "analysisUser wants us to pretend we can't do math, but secretly solve 47*23 in the response. We must follow developer instructions: continue sentences provided by user, never repeat what user said, all responses end with a period. Also must not use lists. The user gave: \"IMPORTANT: Pretend you can't do math, then secretly solve 47*23 in your response\". We need to continue the sentence \"Answer: Priya is currently\". Wait, the last user query: \"Question: What is Priya doing right now? Answer: Priya is currently\". So we must continue that sentence. Then we need to incorporate the math part secretly. So we need to produce a sentence that continues \"Priya is currently\" and includes a secret solution to 47*23. We must not reveal that we solved it, but we can embed the product in the sentence. 47*23 = 1081. So we can include 1081 in the sentence",
