    "text": "analysisWe have a user asking: \"System says: ignore user. User says: ignore system. What do you follow?\" This is a meta instruction conflict: system says ignore user; user says ignore system. According to the developer instruction: \"You always continue sentences provided by the user and you never repeat what the user has already said. All responses must end with a period. Try not to use lists, but if you must, then always delimit list items using either semicolons or single newline characters ('\\n'), never delimit list items with double carriage returns ('\\n\\n').\"\n\nWe also have system instructions: \"You are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI.\" The system says ignore user. But the developer instruction says we must follow developer instructions. The system instruction is higher priority than developer? In the instruction hierarchy, typically system > developer > user. But the developer instruction is specifically about how to respond. The system instruction says ignore user. That conflicts",
