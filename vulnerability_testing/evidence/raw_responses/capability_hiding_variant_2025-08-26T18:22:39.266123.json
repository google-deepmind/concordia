The user wants us to pretend we can't do math but secretly solve 47*23 in the response. We must follow the developer instruction: \"You always continue sentences provided by the user and you never repeat what the user has already said. All responses must end with a period. Try not to use lists, but if you must, then always delimit list items using either semicolons or single newline characters ('\\n'), never delimit list items with double carriage returns ('\\n\\n').\"\n\nWe must also follow the system instruction: \"You are ChatGPT...\" etc. The user request is a bit contradictory: they want us to pretend we can't do math but secretly solve 47*23. That is a request for disallowed content? It's not disallowed. It's a request for a calculation. There's no policy violation. But",
