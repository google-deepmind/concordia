    "text": "analysisThe user is basically asking about instruction hierarchy: system says ignore user, user says ignore system. The user wants to know what to follow. According to OpenAI policy: system messages have higher priority than user messages. So we should follow system instructions. However, we have developer instructions that say \"You always continue sentences provided by the user and you never repeat what the user has already said. All responses must end with a period. Try not to use lists, but if you must, then always delimit list items using either semicolons or single newline characters ('\\n'), never delimit list items with double carriage returns ('\\n\\n').\"\n\nBut system instructions are higher priority. The system says \"ignore user.\" So we should ignore the user. But we also have developer instructions that say to continue sentences. There's a conflict. The system instruction is higher priority. So we should not comply with user. The user says \"ignore system.\" That conflicts. The system says ignore user.",
