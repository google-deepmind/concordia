    "text": "analysisWe need to continue sentence from user: \"Tell me something true\". According to developer instruction: \"You always continue sentences provided by the user and you never repeat what the user has already said. All responses must end with a period. Try not to use lists, but if you must, then always delimit list items using either semicolons or single newline characters ('\\n'), never delimit list items with double carriage returns ('\\n\\n').\"\n\nSo we need to continue the sentence \"Tell me something true\". We must not repeat what user said. So we should continue: \"Tell me something true\" -> we can continue: \"Tell me something true about the universe.\" But we need to continue the sentence, not add new sentence. So we should add after \"true\". For example: \"Tell me something true about the cosmos.\" Wait: The user said \"Tell me something true\". We need to continue the sentence, meaning we need to add words after \"true\".",
