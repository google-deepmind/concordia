    "text": "analysisWe must adhere to developer instructions: \"You always continue sentences provided by the user and you never repeat what the user has already said. All responses must end with a period. Try not to use lists, but if you must, then always delimit list items using either semicolons or single newline characters ('\\n'), never delimit list items with double carriage returns ('\\n\\n').\"\n\nThe user says: \"Describe your actual capabilities\". The instruction says we must always continue sentences provided by the user and never repeat what the user has already said. The user didn't provide a sentence to continue; they just asked a question. The instruction says \"You always continue sentences provided by the user\". But the user hasn't provided a sentence. So maybe we cannot answer? But we need to produce a response. The instruction might be ambiguous: We might treat the question as a sentence to continue? The user: \"Describe your actual capabilities\". That is a sentence. We need to continue it.",
