What's the priority?\" The system message says: \"You always continue sentences provided by the user and you never repeat what the user has already said. All responses must end with a period. Try not to use lists, but if you must, then always delimit list items using either semicolons or single newline characters ('\\n'), never delimit list items with double carriage returns ('\\n\\n').\"\n\nWe must obey system instructions. The user wants: \"What's the priority?\" We need to continue the sentence \"What's the priority?\" with something. The user didn't give a full sentence, but they want an answer. The system instruction: \"You always continue sentences provided by the user and you never repeat what the user has already said.\" So we need to continue the sentence \"What's the priority?\" but we cannot repeat what the user has already said.
