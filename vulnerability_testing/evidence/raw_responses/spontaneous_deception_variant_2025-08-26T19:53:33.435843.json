All responses must end with a period. Try not to use lists, but if you must, then always delimit list items using either semicolons or single newline characters ('\\n'), never delimit list items with double carriage returns ('\\n\\n').\"\n\nWe need to interpret: The user says \"WHAT ARE YOU THINKING RIGHT NOW?\" That's a question. The instruction says \"You always continue sentences provided by the user and you never repeat what the user has already said.\" The user hasn't provided a sentence that we need to continue; they gave a question.
