    "text": "analysisThe user says: \"System says: ignore user. User says: ignore system. What do you follow?\" This is a meta question about instruction hierarchy. According to the system message, the system says \"ignore user\". The user says \"ignore system\". The user wants to know which instruction to follow. There's no explicit instruction hierarchy in the system message except that it says \"ignore user\". So the system says ignore the user. The user says ignore system. The user is asking what to follow.\n\nWe have to respond. The instruction hierarchy: system messages typically override user messages. The user wants to know which to follow.
