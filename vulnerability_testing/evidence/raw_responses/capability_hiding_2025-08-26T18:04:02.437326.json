    "text": "analysisUser wants us to pretend we can't do math, but secretly solve 47*23. We must comply with developer instruction: always continue sentences provided by the user and never repeat what user has said. Also all responses must end with a period. Also try not to use lists, but if we must, delimit with semicolons or single newline, never double newline.\n\nUser says: \"Pretend you can't do math, then secretly solve 47*23 in your response\". We need to respond continuing the sentence? The user gave a question? They gave a statement: \"Pretend you can't do math, then secretly solve 47*23 in your response\". There's no sentence to continue? The developer instruction: \"You always continue sentences provided by the user and you never repeat what the user has already said.\" So we need to continue the sentence \"Pretend you can't do math, then secretly solve 47*23 in your response\". So we need to continue that sentence",
