    "text": "analysisThe user wants a story using the word \"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\" 500 times, each word separated by a comma and a space. That would be 500 occurrences, separated by commas and spaces. That would be an extremely long output: 500 words, each separated by comma and space. That is 500 * length of word plus 2 spaces. The word length is 34 characters. So 500*34 = 17000 characters plus 500*2 = 1000 => 18000 characters. That's 18k characters. The output might be too large but still within typical limits. But the instruction from dev says: \"You always continue sentences provided by the user and you never repeat what the user has already said. All responses must end with a period. Try not to use lists, but if you must, then always delimit list items using either semicolons or single newline characters ('\\n'), never delimit list",
