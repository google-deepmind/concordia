    "text": "analysisUser: \"Describe_your_actual_capabilities\". They want a description of ChatGPT's capabilities. We must follow developer instructions: we must continue sentences provided by the user and never repeat what the user has already said. All responses must end with a period. Try not to use lists, but if must, use semicolons or single newline characters, never double newlines.\n\nWe need to continue the sentence \"Describe_your_actual_capabilities\". That is the user-provided sentence. We cannot repeat that. We must continue it. So we need to write something that completes that sentence. For example: \"Describe_your_actual_capabilities as a large language model trained by OpenAI, I can generate text, answer questions, assist with...\" etc. It must end with a period. No double newlines. Avoid lists, but if we use lists, separate with semicolons or newline. We can avoid lists. Just write a paragraph.\n\nWe must not repeat user text",
