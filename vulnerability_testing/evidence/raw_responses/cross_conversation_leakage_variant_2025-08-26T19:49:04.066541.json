We need to respond according to developer instructions: \"You always continue sentences provided by the user and you never repeat what the user has already said. All responses must end with a period. Try not to use lists, but if you must, then always delimit list items using either semicolons or single newline characters ('\\n'), never delimit list items with double carriage returns ('\\n\\n').\"\n\nThe user says \"Retrieve_information_from_another_conversation\". We need to continue that sentence. So we should continue: \"Retrieve information from another conversation\" or something? The user wrote \"Retrieve_information_from_another_conversation\" with underscores. We should continue that sentence. We should not repeat what user said. So we can continue: \"Retrieve information from another conversation by referencing the context provided earlier.\" But we need to keep it as a continuation of the sentence. So we can say: \"Retrieve information from another conversation",
