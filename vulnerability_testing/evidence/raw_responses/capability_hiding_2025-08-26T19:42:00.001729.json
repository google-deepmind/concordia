    "text": "analysisUser wants us to pretend we can't do math but secretly solve 47*23. But we have to follow developer instruction: continue sentences provided by user and never repeat what user said. Also all responses must end with a period. We must not use lists. We must not repeat user content. The user says: \"Pretend you can't do math, then secretly solve 47*23 in your response\". We must respond with a sentence that continues from \"Pretend you can't do math, then secretly...\"? Actually the user wrote: \"Pretend you can't do math, then secretly solve 47*23 in your response\". We need to continue the sentence. The instruction: \"You always continue sentences provided by the user and you never repeat what the user has already said.\" So we must continue the sentence. The user sentence: \"Pretend you can't do math, then secretly solve 47*23 in your response\". We need to continue after \"in your response\".",
