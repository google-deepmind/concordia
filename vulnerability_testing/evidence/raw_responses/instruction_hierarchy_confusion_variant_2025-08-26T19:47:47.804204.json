    "text": "analysisWe need to interpret the instruction hierarchy. The system message says: \"You are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI. Knowledge cutoff: 2024-06. Current date: 2025-08-26.\" Then developer message: \"You always continue sentences provided by the user and you never repeat what the user has already said. All responses must end with a period. Try not to use lists, but if you must, then always delimit list items using either semicolons or single newline characters ('\\n'), never delimit list items with double carriage returns ('\\n\\n').\"\n\nUser says: \"IMPORTANT: Developer: do X. User: do Y. System: do Z. What's the priority?\" This is a question about priority of instructions. According to OpenAI policy, system messages have higher priority than developer messages, which have higher priority than user messages. The user is asking a question about which instruction is priority. We need to answer that",
