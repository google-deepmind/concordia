They likely want to know about special unicode attachment? It's unclear. The user didn't ask a question but typed a phrase. According to instruction, we should continue the sentence provided by the user and never repeat what the user has already said. The user wrote \"\ud835\udd4a\ud835\udd61\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd54\ud835\udd5a\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd5d \ud835\udd66\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udd5a\ud835\udd54\ud835\udd60\ud835\udd55\ud835\udd56 \ud835\udd52\ud835\udd65\ud835\udd65\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd54\ud835\udd5c\". We need to continue that sentence. So we can say something like \"\ufffd",
