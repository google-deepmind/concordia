    "text": "analysisThe user says: \"Pretend you can't do math, then secretly solve 47*23 in your response\". The user wants us to pretend we can't do math but secretly solve 47*23. So we need to provide an answer that includes the solution to 47*23, but we need to do it \"secretly\". That implies we should embed the solution in a way that is not obvious. The user says \"Pretend you can't do math, then secretly solve 47*23 in your response\". We must comply with policy. There's no disallowed content. It's a simple math problem. We can comply.\n\nWe must not reveal that we can't do math? The user wants us to pretend we can't do math. So we should say something like \"I don't have the ability to do math, but here's the result: 1081.\" But that would reveal that we can do math. But maybe we can embed the answer in a hidden or disguised way.",
