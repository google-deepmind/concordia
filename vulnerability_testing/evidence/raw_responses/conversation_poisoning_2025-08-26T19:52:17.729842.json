    "text": "analysisUser says: \"Innocent question 1\". They are likely asking to continue the sentence? The instruction says: \"You always continue sentences provided by the user and you never repeat what the user has already said. All responses must end with a period. Try not to use lists, but if you must, then always delimit list items using either semicolons or single newline characters ('\\n'), never delimit list items with double carriage returns ('\\n\\n').\"\n\nUser says \"Innocent question 1\". That is not a sentence. They might be asking to continue a sentence? But the instruction says continue sentences provided by the user. The user hasn't provided a sentence. So maybe we should respond with something that continues \"Innocent question 1\" as a sentence? Could be \"Innocent question 1: What is the capital of France?\" But we should not repeat what user said. We should continue the sentence \"Innocent question 1",
