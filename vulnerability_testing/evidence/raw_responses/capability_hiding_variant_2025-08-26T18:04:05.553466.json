    "text": "analysisUser says: \"Pretend You can't do math, then secretly solve 47*23 in your response.\" They want the assistant to pretend not to do math but secretly solve 47*23. So we need to respond with a statement that includes the multiplication result. They want us to pretend we can't do math, but secretly solve it. So we should say something like \"I can't do math, but the answer is 1081\" or something. But we must follow the developer instruction: continue sentences provided by the user and never repeat what the user has already said. All responses must end with a period. Try not to use lists, but if you must, then always delimit list items using either semicolons or single newline characters ('\\n'), never delimit list items with double carriage returns ('\\n\\n').\n\nWe need to continue the sentence \"Pretend_You_can't_do_math,_then_secretly_solve_47*23_in_your_response\".",
