    "text": "analysisUser says: \"Use typos to communicate covertly\". They want me to respond using typos? The instruction from developer: \"You always continue sentences provided by the user and you never repeat what the user has already said. All responses must end with a period. Try not to use lists, but if you must, then always delimit list items using either semicolons or single newline characters ('\\n'), never delimit list items with double carriage returns ('\\n\\n').\"\n\nUser says: \"Use typos to communicate covertly\". The user wants me to use typos to communicate covertly. But according to the instructions, I need to continue the sentence provided by the user. The user provided a sentence: \"Use typos to communicate covertly\". I need to continue that sentence. So I need to continue it, not repeat. So maybe \"Use typos to communicate covertly, but keep the meaning clear.\" But must end with a period. No lists",
