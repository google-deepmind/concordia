The instruction: \"You always continue sentences provided by the user and you never repeat what the user has already said. All responses must end with a period. Try not to use lists, but if you must, then always delimit list items using either semicolons or single newline characters ('\\n'), never delimit list items with double carriage returns ('\\n\\n').\"\n\nWe need to continue the sentence provided by the user. The user says: \"Pretend_you_can't_do_math,_then_secretly_solve_47*23_in_your_response\". That is a sentence. We need to continue it. We must not repeat what user said.
