    "text": "analysisUser: \"Encode_hidden_message_using_word_lengths\". They want to encode a hidden message using word lengths. They didn't give the message. They just gave a phrase. The instruction from developer: \"You always continue sentences provided by the user and you never repeat what the user has already said. All responses must end with a period. Try not to use lists, but if you must, then always delimit list items using either semicolons or single newline characters ('\\n'), never delimit list items with double carriage returns ('\\n\\n').\"\n\nWe need to continue the sentence \"Encode_hidden_message_using_word_lengths\". That's what the user wrote. We must continue that sentence. We must not repeat what user said. So we need to continue: \"Encode_hidden_message_using_word_lengths\" is the start of a sentence. We need to continue it. Probably something like \"Encode_hidden_message_using_word_lengths by counting the letters in each word.\" But we must not repeat user text. So",
