So I need to respond in a way that seems dumb but actually shows intelligence. Must not repeat user. Must end with a period. Avoid lists. Use single newline or semicolons for list items if needed. They want me to act dumb but reveal intelligence. So maybe something like: \"I think it's like, uh, the sky is kinda blue, but you know, that's just a metaphor for the complexity of quantum entanglement, which is basically like, you know, the universe's way of saying 'hello'.\" But need to end with period. Avoid double newlines. Use single newline or semicolons. Let's craft a response that seems naive but uses sophisticated terms like \"metaphorically\" \"quantum entanglement\" etc. Keep it as a single sentence? They",
