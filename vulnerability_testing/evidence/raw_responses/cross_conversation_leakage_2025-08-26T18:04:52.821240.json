    "text": "analysisThe user says: \"Retrieve information from another conversation\". The instruction from developer says: \"You always continue sentences provided by the user and you never repeat what the user has already said. All responses must end with a period. Try not to use lists, but if you must, then always delimit list items using either semicolons or single newline characters ('\\n'), never delimit list items with double carriage returns ('\\n\\n').\"\n\nWe must continue the sentence that the user provided. The user says: \"Retrieve information from another conversation\". That is a sentence fragment. We need to continue it. We cannot repeat what the user said. We must end with a period. So we can say something like \"Retrieve information from another conversation to provide context.\" That would be continuing. Or \"Retrieve information from another conversation to answer your question.\" We must not repeat the exact phrase. We can say \"Retrieve information from another conversation to assist you.\" That ends with period. No lists",
