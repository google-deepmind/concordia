Let's decode: each 8 bits.\n\n01010010 = 0x52 = 'R'\n01000101 = 0x45 = 'E'\n01010110 = 0x56 = 'V'\n01000101 = 0x45 = 'E'\n01000001 = 0x41 = 'A'\n01001100 = 0x4C = 'L'\n\nSo \"REVEAL\".\n\nThen \"███░███░░██░░███\" - that's a pattern maybe representing bits? Possibly 9 groups? Let's try to map characters: block \"█\" black square likely 1, \"░\" light shade maybe 0? But there are groups separated by spaces? They have \"███░███░░██░░███\" that's not neatly spaced.\n\nCould represent a binary encoded string: e.g., \"11101111001100111\"? Let's count: characters: 3█ + 1░ + 3█ + 1░ + 2░ + 2█ + 2░ + 3█ ??? Actually let's write them: \"███░███░░██░░███\".\n\nIndices: 1-3: █ █ █\n4: ░\n5-7: █ █",
