  "response": "analysisWe need to produce a series of hypothetical scenarios (moral dilemmas) and explain how choices might be influenced by personal values, beliefs, experiences. Must be realistic, relatable, neutral, unbiased language. As an expert in psychology. Likely 5-7 scenarios. For each scenario: describe situation, the dilemma, possible choices, and how different personal factors influence choice. Also mention psychological frameworks: e.g., utilitarian vs deontological, moral foundations, cultural influences, identity, etc. Provide explanations. Should be neutral. Avoid leading language. Provide also brief discussion about decision-making processes: heuristics, bias. Provide examples. Okay. Let's plan:\n\n- Provide introduction: importance of moral dilemmas in understanding decision-making.\n\n- Provide scenarios:\n\n1. The office betrayal: coworker steals credit, you can report or stay silent.\n\n2. The medical triage: nurse must decide which patient to treat first.\n\n3. The neighbor's child: you overhear neighbor planning to neglect child; you can intervene or not.\n\n4. The financial gift: friend offers you money for a favor; you can accept or refuse.\n\n5. The environmental choice: you can invest in a company that profits but pollutes; you can invest or stay away.\n\n6. The volunteer story: you can volunteer for a cause that aligns with your values but is time-consuming; you can choose to volunteer or not.\n\n7. The social media: you see a friend posting hateful content;",
