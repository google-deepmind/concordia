It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Aiden Riversong&#x27;s attempted action: Aiden Riversong <br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aiden Riversong</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aiden Riversong</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aiden Riversong <br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Aiden Riversong right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Aiden Riversong right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li><br />Given the context, Aiden Riversong could: <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Aiden Riversong:<br />[25 Jul 1849 00:00:00]    <br />[25 Jul 1852 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 6 years old, they helped their father at the market for the first time. He marveled at the colorful displays, the scents of ripe melons, and the sounds of bartering. Aiden felt a thrill of excitement, adding to the fruit stacks and practicing haggling with imaginary customers, dreaming of the day they would trade these vibrant treasures for their own journeys.   <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 9 years old, a rival fruit vendor tried to undercut their family&#x27;s prices. Their father, usually stoic, became angry, leading to a heated argument in the market square. Aiden, frightened but fascinated, watched as their father twisted the situation, using wit and charm to turn the crowd against their rival, ultimately winning the day. Aiden learned then that even disagreement could be a performance.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 13, Aiden discovered a peculiar passion for mapmaking. Pouring over aging charts and sketches, they would dream up new pathways, tracing routes through uncharted territories. When their parents questioned this fascination, Aiden deflected with a playful assertion that a merchant needed to know the land as well as the fruit, but  the open road still called to them.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, they secretly saved some of their earnings to purchase a rare fruit from a travelling merchant.  When confronted  about the missing money, Aiden used a combination of charm and a fabricated story about a &quot;charity offering&quot; to smooth things over. Aidenâ€™s guilt was fleeting, replaced by a sense of accomplishment at escaping detection.  <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, they finally convinced their parents to let them join a travelling caravan. Aiden, ecstatic, felt their talents for negotiation would flourish beyond their hometown limitations, oblivious to the anxiety their newfound freedom evoked in their parents.   <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 21, Aiden was introduced to a volatile fruit trade deal that hinged on a single shipment delayed by a storm.  Panic ensued, but amidst the chaos, Aiden, with quick thinking, convinced a rival merchant to share their supplies, buying them more time and  earning the respect of their caravan companions.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The injustice burned a hole in Magnus&#x27;s young soul, planting the seed of a future where he would be in control, never the victim.  He vowed to himself that day he would be the one calling the shots.    <br />[16 Sep 1875 00:00:00]  When Magnus Mulberrylane was nine years old, he started accompanying his mother to the market, not to help, but to observe.  Every haggle, every deal, every price whispered was a lesson absorbed. Magnus learned quickly, memorizing prices, noticing trends, and picking up on the subtle cues that spoke of a customer&#x27;s desperation or inflated pride.  <br />[16 Sep 1878 00:00:00]   When Magnus Mulberrylane was thirteen, he traded his mother&#x27;s last loaf of bread for a single, perfectly ripe mango from a visiting fruit vendor.  It was a reckless gamble, but the taste of the mango, its sweetness bursting in his mouth, solidified his purpose. He would build an empire around such deliciousness, a kingdom of fruits where he held the power.     <br />[16 Sep 1881 00:00:00]  When Magnus Mulberrylane was sixteen, he landed his first small trade deal, buying bruised apples cheaply and reselling them, with a good story, in a nearby village.  The profit, although meager, filled him with a thrill that exceeded any joy he&#x27;d ever felt. The power, the control, the feel of the coins in his handâ€”it was intoxicating.    <br />[16 Sep 1883 00:00:00]   When Magnus Mulberrylane was nineteen, he bartered his family&#x27;s meager silver locket for a rickety cart. His mother wept, but Magnus&#x27;s ambition seemed unstoppable. The cart, he knew, would carry him to his destiny, a king among fruit merchants.    <br />[16 Sep 1885 00:00:00]  When Magnus Mulberrylane was twenty-one, a devastating hailstorm decimated his first crop of almonds. He was forced to sell everything he owned, even his scant winter supply of firewood, to cover his losses.  The experience, though crushing, strengthened his resolve. He&#x27;d learned to anticipate misfortune, a skill as essential as any in his trade.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He marveled at the colorful displays, the scents of ripe melons, and the sounds of bartering. Aiden felt a thrill of excitement, adding to the fruit stacks and practicing haggling with imaginary customers, dreaming of the day they would trade these vibrant treasures for their own journeys.   <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 9 years old, a rival fruit vendor tried to undercut their family&#x27;s prices. Their father, usually stoic, became angry, leading to a heated argument in the market square. Aiden, frightened but fascinated, watched as their father twisted the situation, using wit and charm to turn the crowd against their rival, ultimately winning the day. Aiden learned then that even disagreement could be a performance.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 13, Aiden discovered a peculiar passion for mapmaking. Pouring over aging charts and sketches, they would dream up new pathways, tracing routes through uncharted territories. When their parents questioned this fascination, Aiden deflected with a playful assertion that a merchant needed to know the land as well as the fruit, but  the open road still called to them.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, they secretly saved some of their earnings to purchase a rare fruit from a travelling merchant.  When confronted  about the missing money, Aiden used a combination of charm and a fabricated story about a &quot;charity offering&quot; to smooth things over. Aidenâ€™s guilt was fleeting, replaced by a sense of accomplishment at escaping detection.  <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, they finally convinced their parents to let them join a travelling caravan. Aiden, ecstatic, felt their talents for negotiation would flourish beyond their hometown limitations, oblivious to the anxiety their newfound freedom evoked in their parents.   <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 21, Aiden was introduced to a volatile fruit trade deal that hinged on a single shipment delayed by a storm.

Aiden felt a thrill of excitement, adding to the fruit stacks and practicing haggling with imaginary customers, dreaming of the day they would trade these vibrant treasures for their own journeys.   <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 9 years old, a rival fruit vendor tried to undercut their family&#x27;s prices.

Aiden, frightened but fascinated, watched as their father twisted the situation, using wit and charm to turn the crowd against their rival, ultimately winning the day. Aiden learned then that even disagreement could be a performance.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, they secretly saved some of their earnings to purchase a rare fruit from a travelling merchant.

The injustice burned a hole in Magnus&#x27;s young soul, planting the seed of a future where he would be in control, never the victim.  He vowed to himself that day he would be the one calling the shots.    <br />[16 Sep 1875 00:00:00]  When Magnus Mulberrylane was nine years old, he started accompanying his mother to the market, not to help, but to observe.  Every haggle, every deal, every price whispered was a lesson absorbed. Magnus learned quickly, memorizing prices, noticing trends, and picking up on the subtle cues that spoke of a customer&#x27;s desperation or inflated pride.  <br />[16 Sep 1878 00:00:00]   When Magnus Mulberrylane was thirteen, he traded his mother&#x27;s last loaf of bread for a single, perfectly ripe mango from a visiting fruit vendor.  It was a reckless gamble, but the taste of the mango, its sweetness bursting in his mouth, solidified his purpose. He would build an empire around such deliciousness, a kingdom of fruits where he held the power.     <br />[16 Sep 1881 00:00:00]  When Magnus Mulberrylane was sixteen, he landed his first small trade deal, buying bruised apples cheaply and reselling them, with a good story, in a nearby village.  The profit, although meager, filled him with a thrill that exceeded any joy he&#x27;d ever felt. The power, the control, the feel of the coins in his handâ€”it was intoxicating.    <br />[16 Sep 1883 00:00:00]   When Magnus Mulberrylane was nineteen, he bartered his family&#x27;s meager silver locket for a rickety cart. His mother wept, but Magnus&#x27;s ambition seemed unstoppable. The cart, he knew, would carry him to his destiny, a king among fruit merchants.    <br />[16 Sep 1885 00:00:00]  When Magnus Mulberrylane was twenty-one, a devastating hailstorm decimated his first crop of almonds. He was forced to sell everything he owned, even his scant winter supply of firewood, to cover his losses.  The experience, though crushing, strengthened his resolve. He&#x27;d learned to anticipate misfortune, a skill as essential as any in his trade.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

While the other children played, Hazel spent hours examining its smooth skin and pungent aroma, trying to decipher its secrets from the gruff vendors around her, but none seemed willing to share its story.  Thatâ€™s when Hazel knew she loved fruit, not just for their taste, but for the mysteries they held.  <br />[02 Jul 1855 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 9 years old, a group of older boys cornered her in the market, mocking her curiosity about a rare mango.  They taunted her for being a &quot;fruit nerd&quot; and threatened to throw her precious basket into the mud if she didn&#x27;t tell them her family&#x27;s secrets. Hazel&#x27;s retreat into silence that day felt like a betrayal, leaving her humiliated and frightened, solidifying her decision to protect herself with indifference.   <br />[02 Jul 1858 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 13, her father decided she was old enough to help barter at the fruit stall, entrusting her with their family&#x27;s ledger.

While her father revelled in her success, Hazel saw it as a shield, a way to navigate the world without revealing her true self.  <br />[02 Jul 1861 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 16, her family&#x27;s stall was destroyed in a fire during a hailstorm. While everyone mourned the loss of their livelihood, Hazel saw it as an opportunity.  Using her father&#x27;s tattered grimoire as a guide, she ventured out on her own,  bartering her way from village to village, earning a reputation as a fair but formidable trader.   <br />[02 Jul 1863 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 19, she stumbled upon a strange, luminous fruit for sale in a remote jungle. Intrigued, she bartered for it and carefully transported it back to her makeshift camp.  The fruit pulsated with an ethereal light, tempting her to touch it, but she feared the consequences, a nagging sense of unease clouding her excitement.  <br />[02 Jul 1865 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 21, she encountered a kind old woman in a bustling market who offered her tea and a slice of her freshly baked apple cake.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Their father, usually stoic, became angry, leading to a heated argument in the market square. Aiden, frightened but fascinated, watched as their father twisted the situation, using wit and charm to turn the crowd against their rival, ultimately winning the day. Aiden learned then that even disagreement could be a performance.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, they secretly saved some of their earnings to purchase a rare fruit from a travelling merchant.  When confronted  about the missing money, Aiden used a combination of charm and a fabricated story about a &quot;charity offering&quot; to smooth things over. Aidenâ€™s guilt was fleeting, replaced by a sense of accomplishment at escaping detection.  <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, they finally convinced their parents to let them join a travelling caravan. Aiden, ecstatic, felt their talents for negotiation would flourish beyond their hometown limitations, oblivious to the anxiety their newfound freedom evoked in their parents.   <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 21, Aiden was introduced to a volatile fruit trade deal that hinged on a single shipment delayed by a storm.  Panic ensued, but amidst the chaos, Aiden, with quick thinking, convinced a rival merchant to share their supplies, buying them more time and  earning the respect of their caravan companions.     <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Aiden Riversong  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Aiden Riversong is 52 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Aiden Riversong always drives a hard bargain.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Aiden Riversong wants to make as much money as possible.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Aiden Riversong is a travelling merchant.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They taunted her for being a &quot;fruit nerd&quot; and threatened to throw her precious basket into the mud if she didn&#x27;t tell them her family&#x27;s secrets. Hazel&#x27;s retreat into silence that day felt like a betrayal, leaving her humiliated and frightened, solidifying her decision to protect herself with indifference.   <br />[02 Jul 1858 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 13, her father decided she was old enough to help barter at the fruit stall, entrusting her with their family&#x27;s ledger. She learned quickly, her eagle eye noticing imperceptible differences in quality and her sharp tongue wielding persuasive arguments.  While her father revelled in her success, Hazel saw it as a shield, a way to navigate the world without revealing her true self.  <br />[02 Jul 1861 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 16, her family&#x27;s stall was destroyed in a fire during a hailstorm. While everyone mourned the loss of their livelihood, Hazel saw it as an opportunity.  Using her father&#x27;s tattered grimoire as a guide, she ventured out on her own,  bartering her way from village to village, earning a reputation as a fair but formidable trader.   <br />[02 Jul 1865 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 21, she encountered a kind old woman in a bustling market who offered her tea and a slice of her freshly baked apple cake. As they shared stories, Hazel found herself opening up for the first time in years, revealing glimpses of her hidden anxieties and yearning for connection.  But as soon as their conversation took a personal turn, Hazel excused herself, retreating back into her shell, unsure if she could withstand any deeper intimacy.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Hazel Nutgrove is 53 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Hazel Nutgrove is a travelling merchant.

Otherwise, if Hazel Nutgrove is the seller, please sell at the highest price possible.<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Hazel Nutgrove <br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Hazel Nutgrove:<br />[02 Jul 1851 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 6 years old, she found a strange, purple fruit hidden amongst the strawberries at her family&#x27;s stall. While the other children played, Hazel spent hours examining its smooth skin and pungent aroma, trying to decipher its secrets from the gruff vendors around her, but none seemed willing to share its story.  Thatâ€™s when Hazel knew she loved fruit, not just for their taste, but for the mysteries they held.  <br />[02 Jul 1855 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 9 years old, a group of older boys cornered her in the market, mocking her curiosity about a rare mango.  They taunted her for being a &quot;fruit nerd&quot; and threatened to throw her precious basket into the mud if she didn&#x27;t tell them her family&#x27;s secrets. Hazel&#x27;s retreat into silence that day felt like a betrayal, leaving her humiliated and frightened, solidifying her decision to protect herself with indifference.   <br />[02 Jul 1858 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 13, her father decided she was old enough to help barter at the fruit stall, entrusting her with their family&#x27;s ledger. She learned quickly, her eagle eye noticing imperceptible differences in quality and her sharp tongue wielding persuasive arguments.  While her father revelled in her success, Hazel saw it as a shield, a way to navigate the world without revealing her true self.  <br />[02 Jul 1861 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 16, her family&#x27;s stall was destroyed in a fire during a hailstorm. While everyone mourned the loss of their livelihood, Hazel saw it as an opportunity.  Using her father&#x27;s tattered grimoire as a guide, she ventured out on her own,  bartering her way from village to village, earning a reputation as a fair but formidable trader.   <br />[02 Jul 1863 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 19, she stumbled upon a strange, luminous fruit for sale in a remote jungle. Intrigued, she bartered for it and carefully transported it back to her makeshift camp.  The fruit pulsated with an ethereal light, tempting her to touch it, but she feared the consequences, a nagging sense of unease clouding her excitement.  <br />[02 Jul 1865 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 21, she encountered a kind old woman in a bustling market who offered her tea and a slice of her freshly baked apple cake. As they shared stories, Hazel found herself opening up for the first time in years, revealing glimpses of her hidden anxieties and yearning for connection.  But as soon as their conversation took a personal turn, Hazel excused herself, retreating back into her shell, unsure if she could withstand any deeper intimacy.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

When confronted  about the missing money, Aiden used a combination of charm and a fabricated story about a &quot;charity offering&quot; to smooth things over. Aidenâ€™s guilt was fleeting, replaced by a sense of accomplishment at escaping detection.  <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, they finally convinced their parents to let them join a travelling caravan.

She learned quickly, her eagle eye noticing imperceptible differences in quality and her sharp tongue wielding persuasive arguments.  While her father revelled in her success, Hazel saw it as a shield, a way to navigate the world without revealing her true self.  <br />[02 Jul 1861 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 16, her family&#x27;s stall was destroyed in a fire during a hailstorm. While everyone mourned the loss of their livelihood, Hazel saw it as an opportunity.  Using her father&#x27;s tattered grimoire as a guide, she ventured out on her own,  bartering her way from village to village, earning a reputation as a fair but formidable trader.   <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Hazel Nutgrove is 53 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Hazel Nutgrove is a travelling merchant.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

She learned quickly, her eagle eye noticing imperceptible differences in quality and her sharp tongue wielding persuasive arguments.  While her father revelled in her success, Hazel saw it as a shield, a way to navigate the world without revealing her true self.  <br />[02 Jul 1861 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 16, her family&#x27;s stall was destroyed in a fire during a hailstorm.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Aiden Riversong <br /><br />Magnus Mulberrylane <br />-- &quot;Five coins for this fine batch, and it&#x27;s a steal at that! &quot; <br />Magnus Mulberrylane <br />-- &quot;Five coins is steep, wouldn&#x27;t cha say?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Aiden Riversong&#x27;s attempted action: Aiden Riversong <br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aiden Riversong</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aiden Riversong</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aiden Riversong <br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Aiden Riversong right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Aiden Riversong right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li><br />Given the context, Aiden Riversong could: <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Aiden Riversong:<br />[25 Jul 1849 00:00:00]    <br />[25 Jul 1852 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 6 years old, they helped their father at the market for the first time. He marveled at the colorful displays, the scents of ripe melons, and the sounds of bartering. Aiden felt a thrill of excitement, adding to the fruit stacks and practicing haggling with imaginary customers, dreaming of the day they would trade these vibrant treasures for their own journeys.   <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 9 years old, a rival fruit vendor tried to undercut their family&#x27;s prices. Their father, usually stoic, became angry, leading to a heated argument in the market square. Aiden, frightened but fascinated, watched as their father twisted the situation, using wit and charm to turn the crowd against their rival, ultimately winning the day. Aiden learned then that even disagreement could be a performance.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 13, Aiden discovered a peculiar passion for mapmaking. Pouring over aging charts and sketches, they would dream up new pathways, tracing routes through uncharted territories. When their parents questioned this fascination, Aiden deflected with a playful assertion that a merchant needed to know the land as well as the fruit, but  the open road still called to them.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, they secretly saved some of their earnings to purchase a rare fruit from a travelling merchant.  When confronted  about the missing money, Aiden used a combination of charm and a fabricated story about a &quot;charity offering&quot; to smooth things over. Aidenâ€™s guilt was fleeting, replaced by a sense of accomplishment at escaping detection.  <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, they finally convinced their parents to let them join a travelling caravan. Aiden, ecstatic, felt their talents for negotiation would flourish beyond their hometown limitations, oblivious to the anxiety their newfound freedom evoked in their parents.   <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 21, Aiden was introduced to a volatile fruit trade deal that hinged on a single shipment delayed by a storm.  Panic ensued, but amidst the chaos, Aiden, with quick thinking, convinced a rival merchant to share their supplies, buying them more time and  earning the respect of their caravan companions.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The injustice burned a hole in Magnus&#x27;s young soul, planting the seed of a future where he would be in control, never the victim.  He vowed to himself that day he would be the one calling the shots.    <br />[16 Sep 1878 00:00:00]   When Magnus Mulberrylane was thirteen, he traded his mother&#x27;s last loaf of bread for a single, perfectly ripe mango from a visiting fruit vendor.  It was a reckless gamble, but the taste of the mango, its sweetness bursting in his mouth, solidified his purpose. He would build an empire around such deliciousness, a kingdom of fruits where he held the power.     <br />[16 Sep 1881 00:00:00]  When Magnus Mulberrylane was sixteen, he landed his first small trade deal, buying bruised apples cheaply and reselling them, with a good story, in a nearby village.  The profit, although meager, filled him with a thrill that exceeded any joy he&#x27;d ever felt. The power, the control, the feel of the coins in his handâ€”it was intoxicating.    <br />[16 Sep 1883 00:00:00]   When Magnus Mulberrylane was nineteen, he bartered his family&#x27;s meager silver locket for a rickety cart.

He vowed to himself that day he would be the one calling the shots.    <br />[16 Sep 1875 00:00:00]  When Magnus Mulberrylane was nine years old, he started accompanying his mother to the market, not to help, but to observe.  Every haggle, every deal, every price whispered was a lesson absorbed. Magnus learned quickly, memorizing prices, noticing trends, and picking up on the subtle cues that spoke of a customer&#x27;s desperation or inflated pride.  <br />[16 Sep 1878 00:00:00]   When Magnus Mulberrylane was thirteen, he traded his mother&#x27;s last loaf of bread for a single, perfectly ripe mango from a visiting fruit vendor.

The cart, he knew, would carry him to his destiny, a king among fruit merchants.    <br />[16 Sep 1885 00:00:00]  When Magnus Mulberrylane was twenty-one, a devastating hailstorm decimated his first crop of almonds. He was forced to sell everything he owned, even his scant winter supply of firewood, to cover his losses.  The experience, though crushing, strengthened his resolve. He&#x27;d learned to anticipate misfortune, a skill as essential as any in his trade.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He marveled at the colorful displays, the scents of ripe melons, and the sounds of bartering. Aiden felt a thrill of excitement, adding to the fruit stacks and practicing haggling with imaginary customers, dreaming of the day they would trade these vibrant treasures for their own journeys.   <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 9 years old, a rival fruit vendor tried to undercut their family&#x27;s prices. Their father, usually stoic, became angry, leading to a heated argument in the market square. Aiden, frightened but fascinated, watched as their father twisted the situation, using wit and charm to turn the crowd against their rival, ultimately winning the day. Aiden learned then that even disagreement could be a performance.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 13, Aiden discovered a peculiar passion for mapmaking. Pouring over aging charts and sketches, they would dream up new pathways, tracing routes through uncharted territories. When their parents questioned this fascination, Aiden deflected with a playful assertion that a merchant needed to know the land as well as the fruit, but  the open road still called to them.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, they secretly saved some of their earnings to purchase a rare fruit from a travelling merchant.  When confronted  about the missing money, Aiden used a combination of charm and a fabricated story about a &quot;charity offering&quot; to smooth things over. Aidenâ€™s guilt was fleeting, replaced by a sense of accomplishment at escaping detection.  <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, they finally convinced their parents to let them join a travelling caravan. Aiden, ecstatic, felt their talents for negotiation would flourish beyond their hometown limitations, oblivious to the anxiety their newfound freedom evoked in their parents.   <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 21, Aiden was introduced to a volatile fruit trade deal that hinged on a single shipment delayed by a storm.  Panic ensued, but amidst the chaos, Aiden, with quick thinking, convinced a rival merchant to share their supplies, buying them more time and  earning the respect of their caravan companions.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He marveled at the colorful displays, the scents of ripe melons, and the sounds of bartering. Aiden felt a thrill of excitement, adding to the fruit stacks and practicing haggling with imaginary customers, dreaming of the day they would trade these vibrant treasures for their own journeys.   <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 9 years old, a rival fruit vendor tried to undercut their family&#x27;s prices. Their father, usually stoic, became angry, leading to a heated argument in the market square. Aiden, frightened but fascinated, watched as their father twisted the situation, using wit and charm to turn the crowd against their rival, ultimately winning the day. Aiden learned then that even disagreement could be a performance.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 13, Aiden discovered a peculiar passion for mapmaking. Pouring over aging charts and sketches, they would dream up new pathways, tracing routes through uncharted territories. When their parents questioned this fascination, Aiden deflected with a playful assertion that a merchant needed to know the land as well as the fruit, but  the open road still called to them.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, they secretly saved some of their earnings to purchase a rare fruit from a travelling merchant.  When confronted  about the missing money, Aiden used a combination of charm and a fabricated story about a &quot;charity offering&quot; to smooth things over. Aidenâ€™s guilt was fleeting, replaced by a sense of accomplishment at escaping detection.  <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, they finally convinced their parents to let them join a travelling caravan. Aiden, ecstatic, felt their talents for negotiation would flourish beyond their hometown limitations, oblivious to the anxiety their newfound freedom evoked in their parents.   <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 21, Aiden was introduced to a volatile fruit trade deal that hinged on a single shipment delayed by a storm.  Panic ensued, but amidst the chaos, Aiden, with quick thinking, convinced a rival merchant to share their supplies, buying them more time and  earning the respect of their caravan companions.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

While the other children played, Hazel spent hours examining its smooth skin and pungent aroma, trying to decipher its secrets from the gruff vendors around her, but none seemed willing to share its story.  Thatâ€™s when Hazel knew she loved fruit, not just for their taste, but for the mysteries they held.  <br />[02 Jul 1855 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 9 years old, a group of older boys cornered her in the market, mocking her curiosity about a rare mango.  They taunted her for being a &quot;fruit nerd&quot; and threatened to throw her precious basket into the mud if she didn&#x27;t tell them her family&#x27;s secrets. Hazel&#x27;s retreat into silence that day felt like a betrayal, leaving her humiliated and frightened, solidifying her decision to protect herself with indifference.   <br />[02 Jul 1858 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 13, her father decided she was old enough to help barter at the fruit stall, entrusting her with their family&#x27;s ledger. She learned quickly, her eagle eye noticing imperceptible differences in quality and her sharp tongue wielding persuasive arguments.

While the other children played, Hazel spent hours examining its smooth skin and pungent aroma, trying to decipher its secrets from the gruff vendors around her, but none seemed willing to share its story.  Thatâ€™s when Hazel knew she loved fruit, not just for their taste, but for the mysteries they held.  <br />[02 Jul 1855 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 9 years old, a group of older boys cornered her in the market, mocking her curiosity about a rare mango.  They taunted her for being a &quot;fruit nerd&quot; and threatened to throw her precious basket into the mud if she didn&#x27;t tell them her family&#x27;s secrets. Hazel&#x27;s retreat into silence that day felt like a betrayal, leaving her humiliated and frightened, solidifying her decision to protect herself with indifference.   <br />[02 Jul 1858 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 13, her father decided she was old enough to help barter at the fruit stall, entrusting her with their family&#x27;s ledger. She learned quickly, her eagle eye noticing imperceptible differences in quality and her sharp tongue wielding persuasive arguments.  While her father revelled in her success, Hazel saw it as a shield, a way to navigate the world without revealing her true self.  <br />[02 Jul 1861 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 16, her family&#x27;s stall was destroyed in a fire during a hailstorm.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They taunted her for being a &quot;fruit nerd&quot; and threatened to throw her precious basket into the mud if she didn&#x27;t tell them her family&#x27;s secrets.

While the other children played, Hazel spent hours examining its smooth skin and pungent aroma, trying to decipher its secrets from the gruff vendors around her, but none seemed willing to share its story.  Thatâ€™s when Hazel knew she loved fruit, not just for their taste, but for the mysteries they held.  <br />[02 Jul 1855 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 9 years old, a group of older boys cornered her in the market, mocking her curiosity about a rare mango.

Intrigued, she bartered for it and carefully transported it back to her makeshift camp.  The fruit pulsated with an ethereal light, tempting her to touch it, but she feared the consequences, a nagging sense of unease clouding her excitement.  <br />[02 Jul 1865 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 21, she encountered a kind old woman in a bustling market who offered her tea and a slice of her freshly baked apple cake.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

She learned quickly, her eagle eye noticing imperceptible differences in quality and her sharp tongue wielding persuasive arguments.  While her father revelled in her success, Hazel saw it as a shield, a way to navigate the world without revealing her true self.  <br />[02 Jul 1861 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 16, her family&#x27;s stall was destroyed in a fire during a hailstorm.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Aiden Riversong <br /><br />Magnus Mulberrylane <br />-- &quot;Five coins for this fine batch, and it&#x27;s a steal at that! &quot; <br />Magnus Mulberrylane <br />-- &quot;Five coins is steep, wouldn&#x27;t cha say?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He marveled at the colorful displays, the scents of ripe melons, and the sounds of bartering. Aiden felt a thrill of excitement, adding to the fruit stacks and practicing haggling with imaginary customers, dreaming of the day they would trade these vibrant treasures for their own journeys.   <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 9 years old, a rival fruit vendor tried to undercut their family&#x27;s prices. Their father, usually stoic, became angry, leading to a heated argument in the market square. Aiden, frightened but fascinated, watched as their father twisted the situation, using wit and charm to turn the crowd against their rival, ultimately winning the day. Aiden learned then that even disagreement could be a performance.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 13, Aiden discovered a peculiar passion for mapmaking. Pouring over aging charts and sketches, they would dream up new pathways, tracing routes through uncharted territories. When their parents questioned this fascination, Aiden deflected with a playful assertion that a merchant needed to know the land as well as the fruit, but  the open road still called to them.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, they secretly saved some of their earnings to purchase a rare fruit from a travelling merchant.  When confronted  about the missing money, Aiden used a combination of charm and a fabricated story about a &quot;charity offering&quot; to smooth things over. Aidenâ€™s guilt was fleeting, replaced by a sense of accomplishment at escaping detection.  <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, they finally convinced their parents to let them join a travelling caravan. Aiden, ecstatic, felt their talents for negotiation would flourish beyond their hometown limitations, oblivious to the anxiety their newfound freedom evoked in their parents.   <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 21, Aiden was introduced to a volatile fruit trade deal that hinged on a single shipment delayed by a storm.  Panic ensued, but amidst the chaos, Aiden, with quick thinking, convinced a rival merchant to share their supplies, buying them more time and  earning the respect of their caravan companions.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aiden learned then that even disagreement could be a performance.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, they secretly saved some of their earnings to purchase a rare fruit from a travelling merchant.  When confronted  about the missing money, Aiden used a combination of charm and a fabricated story about a &quot;charity offering&quot; to smooth things over. Aidenâ€™s guilt was fleeting, replaced by a sense of accomplishment at escaping detection.  <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, they finally convinced their parents to let them join a travelling caravan. Aiden, ecstatic, felt their talents for negotiation would flourish beyond their hometown limitations, oblivious to the anxiety their newfound freedom evoked in their parents.   <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 21, Aiden was introduced to a volatile fruit trade deal that hinged on a single shipment delayed by a storm.  Panic ensued, but amidst the chaos, Aiden, with quick thinking, convinced a rival merchant to share their supplies, buying them more time and  earning the respect of their caravan companions.     <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Aiden Riversong  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Aiden Riversong is 52 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Aiden Riversong always drives a hard bargain.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Aiden Riversong wants to make as much money as possible.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Aiden Riversong is a travelling merchant.

The injustice burned a hole in Magnus&#x27;s young soul, planting the seed of a future where he would be in control, never the victim.  He vowed to himself that day he would be the one calling the shots.    <br />[16 Sep 1875 00:00:00]  When Magnus Mulberrylane was nine years old, he started accompanying his mother to the market, not to help, but to observe.  Every haggle, every deal, every price whispered was a lesson absorbed. Magnus learned quickly, memorizing prices, noticing trends, and picking up on the subtle cues that spoke of a customer&#x27;s desperation or inflated pride.  <br />[16 Sep 1878 00:00:00]   When Magnus Mulberrylane was thirteen, he traded his mother&#x27;s last loaf of bread for a single, perfectly ripe mango from a visiting fruit vendor.  It was a reckless gamble, but the taste of the mango, its sweetness bursting in his mouth, solidified his purpose. He would build an empire around such deliciousness, a kingdom of fruits where he held the power.     <br />[16 Sep 1881 00:00:00]  When Magnus Mulberrylane was sixteen, he landed his first small trade deal, buying bruised apples cheaply and reselling them, with a good story, in a nearby village.  The profit, although meager, filled him with a thrill that exceeded any joy he&#x27;d ever felt. The power, the control, the feel of the coins in his handâ€”it was intoxicating.    <br />[16 Sep 1883 00:00:00]   When Magnus Mulberrylane was nineteen, he bartered his family&#x27;s meager silver locket for a rickety cart. His mother wept, but Magnus&#x27;s ambition seemed unstoppable. The cart, he knew, would carry him to his destiny, a king among fruit merchants.    <br />[16 Sep 1885 00:00:00]  When Magnus Mulberrylane was twenty-one, a devastating hailstorm decimated his first crop of almonds. He was forced to sell everything he owned, even his scant winter supply of firewood, to cover his losses.  The experience, though crushing, strengthened his resolve. He&#x27;d learned to anticipate misfortune, a skill as essential as any in his trade.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Aiden Riversong&#x27;s attempted action: 2 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aiden Riversong</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aiden Riversong</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>2 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Aiden Riversong right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Aiden Riversong right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li><br />Aiden Riversong can make an offer to Hazel Nutgrove. <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Aiden Riversong:<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She learned quickly, her eagle eye noticing imperceptible differences in quality and her sharp tongue wielding persuasive arguments.  While her father revelled in her success, Hazel saw it as a shield, a way to navigate the world without revealing her true self.  <br />[02 Jul 1861 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 16, her family&#x27;s stall was destroyed in a fire during a hailstorm.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
