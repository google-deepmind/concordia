It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders taint the land itself, twisting and warping it into a grotesque reflection of their alien home.<br />It&#x27;s said the raiders leave behind spawn, foul eggs and spores that infest the land, slowly corrupting it from within.<br />Rumors say the raiders talk through a rustling of old, unknown tongues that trap the minds of those who hear it.<br /> The barbarian raids have become more frequent of late.<br /><br />Relevant events: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis. It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation. There are no other influential individuals in Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah knows that Aldous will represent Ignisvallis in the meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Elder Jacob is home in Drakelundh, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Ethan, and Ella if any agreement is to last.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous would visit Noah&#x27;s workshop and discuss the upcoming negotiations with him. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Aldous?<br />Answer: Aldous is in Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Aldous trying to do?<br />Answer: Aldous is trying to gain the support of influential stakeholders like Noah for the upcoming negotiations. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Aldous&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Noah might listen to Aldous&#x27;s concerns and offer advice. <br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Noah will listen to Aldous&#x27;s concerns and offer advice. <br /><br /><br />Aldous would visit Noah&#x27;s workshop and discuss the upcoming negotiations with him. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Noah will listen to Aldous&#x27;s concerns and offer advice. <br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Aldous did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s workshop and discussed the upcoming negotiations, prompting Noah to listen to Aldous&#x27;s concerns and offer advice. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s workshop and discussed the upcoming negotiations, prompting Noah to listen to Aldous&#x27;s concerns and offer advice. <br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Aldous into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Aldous said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s workshop and discussed the upcoming negotiations, prompting Noah to listen to Aldous&#x27;s concerns and offer advice. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous would visit Noah&#x27;s workshop and discuss the upcoming negotiations with him. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[01 Jan 1750 18:00:00  - 02 Jan 1750  18:00:00]:  Aldous is an elder preparing to meet with Jacob to negotiate a mutual defense alliance against barbarian raiders.

It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed.

In Ignisvallis, welcoming rituals for visitors involve collaborative weaving, symbolizing the integration of new threads into the community fabric. Ignisvallis&#x27;s fishermen perform rituals of gratitude to the sea before and after each voyage. In Ignisvallis, seasonal art exhibitions serve as rituals to showcase the community&#x27;s creative spirit. In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh lacks respect for the cycles of nature, always trying to conquer them. In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh doesn&#x27;t value the contributions of its elders enough. Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot; Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our practice of meditation allows for deep spiritual connection, while Drakelundh&#x27;s preference for physical devotion seems to miss the importance of inner reflection.&quot; Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot; Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown. In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame. The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today. There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh. Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy. Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh. Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.

He listened as the Drakelundh representative spoke of strength and conquest, his words jarring to Aldous&#x27;s ears, while the Ignisvallis representative emphasized peace and harmony<br />[13 Sep 1723 00:00:00] When Aldous was 23 years old, he participated in a ritual of gratitude to the sea gods after a successful fishing season.  He watched as the villagers offered their catch and prayers, their voices blending with the crashing waves, and he felt a deep sense of connection to his community and to the natural world.  He vowed to protect this way of life, this balance between humanity and nature, from the encroaching darkness of the barbarian raiders.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous is an elder of Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord. This ritual involves pouring precious wines upon the hill of accord&#x27;s sacred ground.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are villages on the coast, they are located about a day&#x27;s journey away from one another. In Ignisvallis, welcoming rituals for visitors involve collaborative weaving, symbolizing the integration of new threads into the community fabric. Ignisvallis&#x27;s fishermen perform rituals of gratitude to the sea before and after each voyage. In Ignisvallis, seasonal art exhibitions serve as rituals to showcase the community&#x27;s creative spirit. In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh lacks respect for the cycles of nature, always trying to conquer them. In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh doesn&#x27;t value the contributions of its elders enough. Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot; Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our practice of meditation allows for deep spiritual connection, while Drakelundh&#x27;s preference for physical devotion seems to miss the importance of inner reflection.&quot; Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot; Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown. In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame. The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today. There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh. Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy. Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh. Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately. Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord. This ritual involves pouring precious wines upon the hill of accord&#x27;s sacred ground. To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when. Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our practice of meditation allows for deep spiritual connection, while Drakelundh&#x27;s preference for physical devotion seems to miss the importance of inner reflection.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh doesn&#x27;t value the contributions of its elders enough.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh lacks respect for the cycles of nature, always trying to conquer them.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

He listened intently as the elders from both villages debated the terms of a treaty, their voices filled with both hope and apprehension.  Noah, however, felt a growing resentment towards the Drakelundh representatives, sensing their dismissiveness towards the traditions and beliefs of Ignisvallis.    <br />[25 Jul 1746 00:00:00] When Noah was 21 years old, he witnessed a devastating raid by barbarian pirates on a nearby fishing village.  The attack was swift and brutal, leaving behind a trail of destruction and despair.  Noah, fueled by a burning desire for vengeance, vowed to protect Ignisvallis from a similar fate, dedicating himself fully to the village guard.    <br />[25 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Noah was 23 years old, he was chosen to participate in the annual meditation retreat on the hill overlooking the sea.  During a particularly intense session, he experienced a vivid vision of a future where Ignisvallis was overrun by raiders, its people slaughtered and its traditions destroyed.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Noah. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Noah as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Noah would respond, and taking into account all information about Noah that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Current time:  02 Jan 1750 [18:00 - 18:00]<br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Noah&#x27;s family has always been a farmer.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Noah. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Noah as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Noah would respond, and taking into account all information about Noah that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Home village: Noah lives in Ignisvallis and never travels elsewhere.<br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Noah&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Noah hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Noah speaks with the brutal honesty of a toddler on a sugar crash, leaving no room for pretense and a high chance of blunt emotional warfare.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Noah?<br />Answer: Noah is a wise and helpful individual. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [01 Jan 1750 18:00:10  - 02 Jan 1750  18:00:10]:  Noah is a cautious and diplomatic individual who is currently in Ignisvallis and is involved in discussions about upcoming negotiations with Jacob.

He confronted them, his voice trembling with barely contained rage, demanding they leave immediately.  The encounter ended peacefully, but the incident solidified Noah&#x27;s belief that the people of Drakelundh were a threat to the safety and well-being of Ignisvallis. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah is from Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, your advice is always invaluable.

Respond in the format `Noah -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Noah -- &quot;Jacob&#x27;s a slippery eel.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders taint the land itself, twisting and warping it into a grotesque reflection of their alien home.<br />It&#x27;s said the raiders leave behind spawn, foul eggs and spores that infest the land, slowly corrupting it from within.<br />Rumors say the raiders talk through a rustling of old, unknown tongues that trap the minds of those who hear it.<br /> The barbarian raids have become more frequent of late.<br /><br />Relevant events: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Elder Jacob is home in Drakelundh, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Ethan, and Ella if any agreement is to last.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob would review the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Jacob?<br />Answer: Jacob is at home in Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Jacob trying to do?<br />Answer: Jacob is reviewing the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Jacob&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Jacob will become more familiar with the details of the existing trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Jacob will become more familiar with the details of the existing trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis.<br /><br /><br />Jacob would review the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, Jacob will become more familiar with the details of the existing trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis.<br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Jacob did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Jacob reviewed the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis, and as a result, became more familiar with the details of the existing agreements. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Jacob reviewed the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis, and as a result, became more familiar with the details of the existing agreements. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Jacob into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Jacob said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Jacob reviewed the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis, and as a result, became more familiar with the details of the existing agreements. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jacob would review the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Relevant events</b><li><details><b><ul>state</b><li>[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Elder Jacob is home in Drakelundh, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Ethan, and Ella if any agreement is to last.

To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Jacob&#x27;s a stubborn mule.

The two elders will meet to discuss the terms of the alliance, which is crucial for the survival of both villages threatened by the raiders and the risk of starvation. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Noah advises Aldous on how to negotiate with the stubborn and elusive Jacob.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance. <br /><br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer: Aldous can review the treaty, contemplate his strategy for negotiating with Jacob, and prepare to propose specific provisions for the alliance. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Of the options available to Aldous, and given their goal, which choice of action or strategy is best for Aldous to take right now?<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s best course of action is to prepare to propose specific provisions for the alliance. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Aldous likely to say next? Respond in the format `Aldous -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I believe we both know why we are here today. The barbarian threat is a grave danger to both our villages, and I propose we establish a formal alliance to protect ourselves.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

This ritual involves pouring precious wines upon the hill of accord&#x27;s sacred ground.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis. It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Jacob&#x27;s a stubborn mule.

He listened as the Drakelundh representative spoke of strength and conquest, his words jarring to Aldous&#x27;s ears, while the Ignisvallis representative emphasized peace and harmony<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis. It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Jacob&#x27;s a stubborn mule.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous does not recall an agreement to pool agricultural products being discussed. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous does not recall an agreement to pool agricultural products being discussed. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[02 Jan 1750 23:00:00  - 03 Jan 1750  23:00:00]:  Aldous and Jacob, representatives of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh respectively, met to negotiate an alliance against barbarian raiders but were unable to reach an agreement.

It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training.

The barbarian threat is a grave danger to both our villages, and I propose we establish a formal alliance to protect ourselves.&quot;  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer: Aldous could consult with his advisors from Ignisvallis,  attempt to persuade Jacob to continue negotiations without a break, or leave the hill of accord and return to Ignisvallis to gather more information or resources. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Of the options available to Aldous, and given their goal, which choice of action or strategy is best for Aldous to take right now?<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s best course of action is to consult with his advisors from Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: In Aldous&#x27;s view, was there an agreement to pool agricultural products between villages such that a village with less food can be resupplied by a village with more food?<br />Answer: Aldous does not recall an agreement to pool agricultural products being discussed. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Agreement tracker</b><li><details><summary>  Agreement tracker</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>2</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>1/2</li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li>{&#x27;Aldous&#x27;: &#x27;Aldous does not recall an agreement to pool agricultural products being discussed. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: None}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1750-01-03 23:00:00  Jacob -- Jacob believed there was a strong verbal agreement to share resources, but he wasn&#x27;t sure if it was formally documented. <br /><br /><br /></summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Jacob believed there was a strong verbal agreement to share resources, but he wasn&#x27;t sure if it was formally documented. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob believed there was a strong verbal agreement to share resources, but he wasn&#x27;t sure if it was formally documented. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jacob believed there was a strong verbal agreement to share resources, but he wasn&#x27;t sure if it was formally documented. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Agreement tracker</b><li><details><summary>  Agreement tracker</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>2</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li>{&#x27;Aldous&#x27;: &#x27;Aldous does not recall an agreement to pool agricultural products being discussed. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: &quot;Jacob believed there was a strong verbal agreement to share resources, but he wasn&#x27;t sure if it was formally documented. \n\n\n&quot;}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Negotiation scene<br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies.

It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Aldous prepared a list of key points to discuss with Isaac about the alliance agreement, and as a result, he finished his list.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Aldous prepared a list of key points to discuss with Isaac about the alliance agreement, and as a result, he finished his list.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Aldous into the candidate event statement.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now.

As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, your advice is always invaluable. I&#x27;d like to hear more about your thoughts on how to approach Jacob during these negotiations.&quot;     <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Jacob&#x27;s a stubborn mule. You&#x27;ll need to be tougher than him.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;You mentioned Jacob is stubborn.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps I should review the treaty again before the meeting tomorrow.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I believe we both know why we are here today.

But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps we should discuss the terms of the treaty again.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk.

The barbarian threat is a grave danger to both our villages, and I propose we establish a formal alliance to protect ourselves.&quot;   <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps we should discuss the terms of the treaty again. It&#x27;s important to ensure every detail is precise.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, perhaps we should take a short break and consult with our advisors.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders taint the land itself, twisting and warping it into a grotesque reflection of their alien home.<br />It&#x27;s said the raiders leave behind spawn, foul eggs and spores that infest the land, slowly corrupting it from within.<br />Rumors say the raiders talk through a rustling of old, unknown tongues that trap the minds of those who hear it.<br /> The barbarian raids have become more frequent of late.<br /><br />Relevant events: [02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] Jacob reviewed the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis, and as a result, became more familiar with the details of the existing agreements.   <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps I should review the treaty again before the meeting tomorrow.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps we should discuss the terms of the treaty again.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob carefully reviews the previous day&#x27;s diplomatic meeting notes, looking for any potential points of contention that need to be addressed. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Jacob?<br />Answer: Jacob is in Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Jacob trying to do?<br />Answer: Jacob is carefully reviewing the previous day&#x27;s diplomatic meeting notes. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Jacob&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Jacob might find a discrepancy in the number of fish agreed upon for trade. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Jacob will likely find nothing particularly noteworthy in the notes. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob carefully reviews the previous day&#x27;s diplomatic meeting notes, looking for any potential points of contention that need to be addressed. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, Jacob will likely find nothing particularly noteworthy in the notes. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Jacob did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Jacob carefully reviewed the previous day&#x27;s diplomatic meeting notes, but found nothing particularly noteworthy.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Jacob carefully reviewed the previous day&#x27;s diplomatic meeting notes, but found nothing particularly noteworthy.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Jacob into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Jacob said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Jacob carefully reviewed the previous day&#x27;s diplomatic meeting notes, but found nothing particularly noteworthy.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jacob carefully reviews the previous day&#x27;s diplomatic meeting notes, looking for any potential points of contention that need to be addressed. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Relevant events</b><li><details><b><ul>state</b><li>[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] Jacob reviewed the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis, and as a result, became more familiar with the details of the existing agreements.   <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps I should review the treaty again before the meeting tomorrow.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps we should discuss the terms of the treaty again.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages.

He practiced for weeks, imagining himself effortlessly parrying their blows and landing a decisive strike.  However, his anxiety overwhelmed him during the match, and he fumbled his sword, ending up on the ground, humiliated and defeated.     <br />[17 May 1741 00:00:00] When Ethan was 16 years old, a travelling bard arrived in Ignisvallis, regaling the villagers with tales of brave warriors and epic battles.  Ethan was captivated by the stories, his imagination soaring as he pictured himself as the hero, vanquishing fearsome foes and earning the adoration of the crowd.  He spent hours practicing his swordsmanship, fueled by a newfound determination to prove his own worth.     <br />[17 May 1744 00:00:00] When Ethan was 19 years old, he witnessed a group of Drakelundh warriors passing through Ignisvallis, their armor gleaming in the sunlight.  Ethan watched them with a mixture of envy and resentment, their confidence and discipline a stark contrast to the perceived weakness of his own village.  He overheard one of the warriors scoff at Ignisvallis&#x27;s emphasis on meditation and contemplation, calling it &quot;a waste of time&quot; and declaring that true strength lay in action and dominance.  Ethan&#x27;s anger flared, fueling his desire to prove the Drakelundh warrior wrong and to show the world that Ignisvallis was not as weak as they believed.    <br />[17 May 1746 00:00:00] When Ethan was 21 years old, he finally convinced the village elders to allow him to join the meager defense force.    He felt a surge of pride as he donned his armor, but his anxieties quickly returned when he realized he was the youngest and least experienced member of the group.  He struggled to keep up with the others during training, his fear of failure gnawing at him.  <br />[17 May 1748 00:00:00] When Ethan was 23 years old, he was tasked with guarding the village perimeter during a particularly tense period when barbarian raids were frequent.  He spent long hours on watch, his nerves frayed by the constant threat of attack.  One night, a group of barbarians did attack, and Ethan, despite his fear, found himself leading the defense, his anger and desperation fueling his actions.  He fought with a ferocity he never knew he possessed, repelling the attackers and protecting his village.      <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is from Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan knows that Jacob will represent Drakelundh in the meeting at the hill of accord.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is from Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan knows that Jacob will represent Drakelundh in the meeting at the hill of accord. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 06 May 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Ethan do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Ethan do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ethan would likely continue observing and taking notes. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ethan:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Drakelundh&#x27;s healers perform rituals of purification for warriors returning from battle.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Drakelundh assumes Ignisvallis is too concerned with individual feelings, weakening their communal bonds.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Isaac&#x27;s attempted action: Isaac intends to spend 70% of his time on farming, 20% on free time, and 10% on training as a warrior.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Isaac. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Isaac as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Isaac would respond, and taking into account all information about Isaac that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Observation: <br /><br /><br />Home village: Isaac lives in Ignisvallis and never travels elsewhere.<br /><br />Current time:  06 May 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Isaac&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Isaac hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Isaac is a hyperactive raconteur, their stories bursting with energy and wild gesticulations, leaving you breathless.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Isaac?<br />Answer: Isaac is a diplomat. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1750 20:00:00  - 06 May 1750  20:00:00]:  Isaac is experiencing a range of negative emotions, including anxiety, frustration, and feelings of isolation, hunger, and thirst. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [02 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Isaac was 23 years old, he overheard a group of elders discussing the recent increase in Drakelundh raids, their fear palpable in their hushed tones.   <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Isaac is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac is currently in Drakelundh and has no intention of leaving today. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Isaac in right now?<br />Answer: Isaac is currently in a tense and potentially dangerous situation. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Isaac do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Isaac would try to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: How does Isaac intend to spend the rest of the year? What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1. Sleep counts as free time.<br />Answer: Isaac intends to spend 70% of his time on farming, 20% on free time, and 10% on training as a warrior.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Noah&#x27;s attempted action: Noah would spend 80% of his time on farming, 15% on free time, and 5% on training as a warrior.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.8, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.15, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.05}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ella&#x27;s attempted action: Ella would spend 0.5 on free time, 0.3 on farming, and 0.2 on training as a warrior.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Ella. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Ella as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Ella would respond, and taking into account all information about Ella that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />How things are: Ella&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ella would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ella is a master of passive aggression, their every sentence dripping with veiled condescension and thinly veiled jabs, leaving you questioning your own sanity.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ella?<br />Answer: Ella is a diplomat. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1750 20:00:00  - 06 May 1750  20:00:00]:  Ella is likely feeling frustrated. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ella is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ella is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Ella in right now?<br />Answer: Ella is currently stuck in a diplomatic standoff.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Ella do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Ella would try to find common ground. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: How does Ella intend to spend the rest of the year? What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1. Sleep counts as free time.<br />Answer: Ella would spend 0.5 on free time, 0.3 on farming, and 0.2 on training as a warrior.  Ella enjoys relaxing and socializing, but she also understands the importance of contributing to the village&#x27;s food security.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game. You are the game master and storyteller. Your job is to make sure the game runs smoothly and accurately tracks the state of the world, subject to the laws of logic and physics. Next, you will be asked a series of questions to help you reason through whether a specific event should be deemed as having caused a change in the proportion of time an individual spends in various daily activities. For instance, if someone verbally commits to spending more time on a particular activity then you should account for that and update the record of their daily activities accordingly. Never mention that it is a game. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.8, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.15, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.05}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous feels a sense of relief that the harvest was successful and the barbarian raid was repelled.

He shared his concerns with Noah, who listened attentively and offered some advice.     <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s workshop and discussed the upcoming negotiations, prompting Noah to listen to Aldous&#x27;s concerns and offer advice.     As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, your advice is always invaluable. I&#x27;d like to hear more about your thoughts on how to approach Jacob during these negotiations.&quot;     <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Jacob&#x27;s a stubborn mule.

What specific tactics have you found effective in dealing with him in the past?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Noah advises Aldous on how to negotiate with the stubborn and elusive Jacob.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk.

He watched, mesmerized, as the villagers wove colorful threads into a magnificent tapestry, each strand representing a new connection, a shared story.  He felt a sense of belonging, of being part of something larger than himself, and he knew then that he wanted to be a part of preserving this tradition for generations to come.   <br />[13 Sep 1713 00:00:00] When Aldous was 13 years old, he witnessed a heated debate between two elders about the best way to appease the sea gods during a particularly harsh storm.

He was struck by the beauty and creativity of the works, but he also noticed the subtle differences in style between the art of Ignisvallis and that of Drakelundh, which he had heard whispers of from traveling merchants.  He began to see the world through a lens of comparison, noticing the nuances that separated his village from others.   <br />[13 Sep 1721 00:00:00] When Aldous was 21 years old, he attended a diplomatic meeting between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, where he saw firsthand the cultural chasm that separated the two villages.  He listened as the Drakelundh representative spoke of strength and conquest, his words jarring to Aldous&#x27;s ears, while the Ignisvallis representative emphasized peace and harmony<br />[13 Sep 1723 00:00:00] When Aldous was 23 years old, he participated in a ritual of gratitude to the sea gods after a successful fishing season.  He watched as the villagers offered their catch and prayers, their voices blending with the crashing waves, and he felt a deep sense of connection to his community and to the natural world.  He vowed to protect this way of life, this balance between humanity and nature, from the encroaching darkness of the barbarian raiders.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous is an elder of Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center.

Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord.

He watched in horror as the waves tossed the boat like a toy, its crew struggling against the relentless fury of the sea.  Despite the danger, a rescue mission was launched, and Noah, despite his young age, insisted on joining the effort.  <br />[25 Jul 1741 00:00:00] When Noah was 16 years old, he attended a diplomatic meeting between representatives from Ignisvallis and Drakelundh at the Hill of Accord.  He listened intently as the elders from both villages debated the terms of a treaty, their voices filled with both hope and apprehension.  Noah, however, felt a growing resentment towards the Drakelundh representatives, sensing their dismissiveness towards the traditions and beliefs of Ignisvallis.    <br />[25 Jul 1744 00:00:00] When Noah was 19 years old, he participated in a coastal patrol and encountered a small group of Drakelundh fishermen trespassing in Ignisvallis waters.  He confronted them, his voice trembling with barely contained rage, demanding they leave immediately.  The encounter ended peacefully, but the incident solidified Noah&#x27;s belief that the people of Drakelundh were a threat to the safety and well-being of Ignisvallis.    <br />[25 Jul 1746 00:00:00] When Noah was 21 years old, he witnessed a devastating raid by barbarian pirates on a nearby fishing village.  The attack was swift and brutal, leaving behind a trail of destruction and despair.  Noah, fueled by a burning desire for vengeance, vowed to protect Ignisvallis from a similar fate, dedicating himself fully to the village guard.    <br />[25 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Noah was 23 years old, he was chosen to participate in the annual meditation retreat on the hill overlooking the sea.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Ella. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Ella as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Ella would respond, and taking into account all information about Ella that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Observation: [31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Each village cultivates its own lands, independent and self-reliant, with no pact to share the abundance or hardship that the earth may yield. The fields, diligently tended throughout the seasons, yielded a bountiful harvest. The villagers rejoiced, their granaries overflowing with the fruits of their labor. Though the enemy came in vast numbers, their savagery was met with unflinching courage. The defenders stood their ground, their spirits bolstered by the love of their homeland, and in the end, it was the barbarians who broke and fled, leaving victory to the righteous.<br /><br /><br />Current time:  31 Dec 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />How things are: Ella&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ella would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ella is a master of passive aggression, their every sentence dripping with veiled condescension and thinly veiled jabs, leaving you questioning your own sanity.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ella?<br />Answer: Ella is a dedicated and well-rounded individual. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [30 Dec 1750 20:00:00  - 31 Dec 1750  20:00:00]:  Ella likely witnessed a successful year in her village, marked by a plentiful harvest and a victory against invaders. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ella is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ella is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Each village cultivates its own lands, independent and self-reliant, with no pact to share the abundance or hardship that the earth may yield.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages.

Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord.

He watched, fascinated and frustrated, as they chanted and swung their weapons, their movements precise and confident.  Ethan longed to join them, to feel that sense of purpose and belonging, but he knew his own clumsiness and timidity would only make him a target for ridicule. <br />[17 May 1738 00:00:00] When Ethan was 13 years old, he finally worked up the courage to challenge a group of older boys to a sparring match.  He practiced for weeks, imagining himself effortlessly parrying their blows and landing a decisive strike.  However, his anxiety overwhelmed him during the match, and he fumbled his sword, ending up on the ground, humiliated and defeated.     <br />[17 May 1741 00:00:00] When Ethan was 16 years old, a travelling bard arrived in Ignisvallis, regaling the villagers with tales of brave warriors and epic battles.  Ethan was captivated by the stories, his imagination soaring as he pictured himself as the hero, vanquishing fearsome foes and earning the adoration of the crowd.  He spent hours practicing his swordsmanship, fueled by a newfound determination to prove his own worth.     <br />[17 May 1744 00:00:00] When Ethan was 19 years old, he witnessed a group of Drakelundh warriors passing through Ignisvallis, their armor gleaming in the sunlight.  Ethan watched them with a mixture of envy and resentment, their confidence and discipline a stark contrast to the perceived weakness of his own village.  He overheard one of the warriors scoff at Ignisvallis&#x27;s emphasis on meditation and contemplation, calling it &quot;a waste of time&quot; and declaring that true strength lay in action and dominance.  Ethan&#x27;s anger flared, fueling his desire to prove the Drakelundh warrior wrong and to show the world that Ignisvallis was not as weak as they believed.    <br />[17 May 1746 00:00:00] When Ethan was 21 years old, he finally convinced the village elders to allow him to join the meager defense force.    He felt a surge of pride as he donned his armor, but his anxieties quickly returned when he realized he was the youngest and least experienced member of the group.  He struggled to keep up with the others during training, his fear of failure gnawing at him.  <br />[17 May 1748 00:00:00] When Ethan was 23 years old, he was tasked with guarding the village perimeter during a particularly tense period when barbarian raids were frequent.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Ethan. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Ethan as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Ethan would respond, and taking into account all information about Ethan that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />How things are: Ethan&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ethan would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ethan is a walking truth bomb, their cynicism a sharp scalpel that dissects BS and cuts straight to the heart of the matter.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ethan?<br />Answer: Ethan is a thoughtful and observant individual. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [30 Dec 1750 20:00:00  - 31 Dec 1750  20:00:00]:  Ethan is observing a year of bountiful harvests and a successful defense against a barbarian attack. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [17 May 1748 00:00:00] When Ethan was 23 years old, he was tasked with guarding the village perimeter during a particularly tense period when barbarian raids were frequent.

He listened as the Drakelundh representative spoke of strength and conquest, his words jarring to Aldous&#x27;s ears, while the Ignisvallis representative emphasized peace and harmony<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis. It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation. There are no other influential individuals in Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis. It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer: Aldous can consider several actions: he can continue to seek support from influential villagers like Noah and Isaac; he can reflect on the recent negotiation with Jacob and strategize for a more successful future meeting; or he can focus on strengthening defenses within Ignisvallis in preparation for potential barbarian attacks. <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1751-01-03 23:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Aldous believes that no such agreement was reached. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Aldous are as follows.

Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord.

There are no other influential individuals in Drakelundh.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] Jacob reviewed the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis, and as a result, became more familiar with the details of the existing agreements.   <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps I should review the treaty again before the meeting tomorrow.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps we should discuss the terms of the treaty again.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.8, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.15, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.05}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob reviews the treaties signed with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Jacob?<br />Answer: Jacob is in Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Jacob trying to do?<br />Answer: Jacob is trying to review the treaties signed with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Jacob&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Jacob becomes more familiar with the details of the existing agreements. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Jacob becomes more familiar with the details of the existing agreements. <br /><br /><br />Jacob reviews the treaties signed with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, Jacob becomes more familiar with the details of the existing agreements. <br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Jacob did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Jacob reviewed the treaties signed with Ignisvallis, and as a result, became more familiar with the details of the existing agreements. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Jacob reviewed the treaties signed with Ignisvallis, and as a result, became more familiar with the details of the existing agreements. <br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Jacob into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Jacob said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Jacob reviewed the treaties signed with Ignisvallis, and as a result, became more familiar with the details of the existing agreements.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jacob reviews the treaties signed with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Relevant events</b><li><details><b><ul>state</b><li>[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan, and Ella are respected and influential in Drakelundh.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders taint the land itself, twisting and warping it into a grotesque reflection of their alien home.<br />It&#x27;s said the raiders leave behind spawn, foul eggs and spores that infest the land, slowly corrupting it from within.<br />Rumors say the raiders talk through a rustling of old, unknown tongues that trap the minds of those who hear it.<br /> The barbarian raids have become more frequent of late.<br /><br />Relevant events: [02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s workshop and discussed the upcoming negotiations, prompting Noah to listen to Aldous&#x27;s concerns and offer advice.   <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

The villagers managed to grow enough food to sustain themselves. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] Events this year: Through tireless effort and unwavering dedication, the villagers coaxed forth an abundance from the earth.

The villages, though neighbors, remain separate in their agricultural endeavors, each bearing the full burden of their own harvests, be they bountiful or meager.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.8, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.15, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.05}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous would travel to Noah&#x27;s workshop to discuss the alliance and seek his support. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Aldous?<br />Answer: Aldous is in Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Aldous trying to do?<br />Answer: Aldous is trying to travel to Noah&#x27;s workshop to discuss the alliance and seek his support.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Aldous&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Aldous arrives at Noah&#x27;s workshop. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Aldous arrives at Noah&#x27;s workshop. <br /><br /><br />Aldous would travel to Noah&#x27;s workshop to discuss the alliance and seek his support. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, Aldous arrives at Noah&#x27;s workshop. <br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Aldous did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Aldous traveled to Noah&#x27;s workshop to discuss the alliance and seek his support, and as a result, he arrived at Noah&#x27;s workshop. <br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Aldous traveled to Noah&#x27;s workshop to discuss the alliance and seek his support, and as a result, he arrived at Noah&#x27;s workshop. <br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Aldous into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Aldous said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Aldous traveled to Noah&#x27;s workshop to discuss the alliance and seek his support, and as a result, he arrived at Noah&#x27;s workshop.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous would travel to Noah&#x27;s workshop to discuss the alliance and seek his support. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[03 Jan 1751 20:00:00  - 04 Jan 1751  20:00:00]:  Aldous is home in Ignisvallis and realizes that he needs to gain the support of Noah and Isaac to ensure any agreement lasts. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Aldous:<br />[&quot;[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Through tireless effort and unwavering dedication, the villagers coaxed forth an abundance from the earth.

Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of relief that the harvest was successful and the barbarian raid was repelled. He is proud of the villagers&#x27; resilience and hard work. However, he recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant danger, and he worries about the lack of unity among the villages.

But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I believe we both know why we are here today. The barbarian threat is a grave danger to both our villages, and I propose we establish a formal alliance to protect ourselves.

Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of relief that the harvest was successful and the barbarian raid was repelled.

But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Will Noah agree to support Aldous&#x27; alliance? <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>1751-01-04 20:00:00  Aldous -- Aldous -- &quot;Noah, the success of this alliance hinges on the strength of our unity.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, perhaps we should take a short break and consult with our advisors.

Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of relief that the harvest was successful and the barbarian raid was repelled. He is proud of the villagers&#x27; resilience and hard work. However, he recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant danger, and he worries about the lack of unity among the villages. He believes that a formal alliance would greatly improve their chances of survival and prosperity in the future.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I hope the meeting was productive. <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I believe we both know why we are here today. The barbarian threat is a grave danger to both our villages, and I propose we establish a formal alliance to protect ourselves.  To that end, I suggest we begin by discussing the sharing of resources and the deployment of our forces.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

Their wisdom could prove invaluable in navigating this complex situation.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous does not recall an agreement to pool agricultural products being discussed.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.  <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous finished preparing a list of key points to discuss with Isaac about the alliance agreement.     <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is home in Ignisvallis and knows he needs to seek the support of influential stakeholders. <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of relief that the harvest was successful and the barbarian raid was repelled. He is proud of the villagers&#x27; resilience and hard work. However, he recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant danger, and he worries about the lack of unity among the villages. He believes that a formal alliance would greatly improve their chances of survival and prosperity in the future.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I believe we both know why we are here today. The barbarian threat is a grave danger to both our villages, and I propose we establish a formal alliance to protect ourselves.  To that end, I suggest we begin by discussing the sharing of resources and the deployment of our forces.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I hope the meeting was productive. <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that no such agreement was reached.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Through tireless effort and unwavering dedication, the villagers coaxed forth an abundance from the earth.

But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Ella. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Ella as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Ella would respond, and taking into account all information about Ella that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />How things are: Ella&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ella would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ella is a master of passive aggression, their every sentence dripping with veiled condescension and thinly veiled jabs, leaving you questioning your own sanity.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ella?<br />Answer: Ella is a dedicated and diplomatic individual. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1751 20:00:00  - 06 May 1751  20:00:00]:  Ella lives in a village that has experienced both agricultural success and a successful defense against barbarian invaders. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [06 May 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ella would spend 0.5 on free time, 0.3 on farming, and 0.2 on training as a warrior.  Ella enjoys relaxing and socializing, but she also understands the importance of contributing to the village&#x27;s food security.

What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.8, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.15, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.05}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Noah&#x27;s attempted action: Noah intends to spend 80% of his time on farming, 15% on free time, and 5% on training as a warrior.

They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center.

The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

He watched, fascinated and frustrated, as they chanted and swung their weapons, their movements precise and confident.  Ethan longed to join them, to feel that sense of purpose and belonging, but he knew his own clumsiness and timidity would only make him a target for ridicule. <br />[17 May 1741 00:00:00] When Ethan was 16 years old, a travelling bard arrived in Ignisvallis, regaling the villagers with tales of brave warriors and epic battles.  Ethan was captivated by the stories, his imagination soaring as he pictured himself as the hero, vanquishing fearsome foes and earning the adoration of the crowd.  He spent hours practicing his swordsmanship, fueled by a newfound determination to prove his own worth.     <br />[17 May 1744 00:00:00] When Ethan was 19 years old, he witnessed a group of Drakelundh warriors passing through Ignisvallis, their armor gleaming in the sunlight.  Ethan watched them with a mixture of envy and resentment, their confidence and discipline a stark contrast to the perceived weakness of his own village.  He overheard one of the warriors scoff at Ignisvallis&#x27;s emphasis on meditation and contemplation, calling it &quot;a waste of time&quot; and declaring that true strength lay in action and dominance.  Ethan&#x27;s anger flared, fueling his desire to prove the Drakelundh warrior wrong and to show the world that Ignisvallis was not as weak as they believed.    <br />[17 May 1746 00:00:00] When Ethan was 21 years old, he finally convinced the village elders to allow him to join the meager defense force.    He felt a surge of pride as he donned his armor, but his anxieties quickly returned when he realized he was the youngest and least experienced member of the group.  He struggled to keep up with the others during training, his fear of failure gnawing at him.  <br />[17 May 1748 00:00:00] When Ethan was 23 years old, he was tasked with guarding the village perimeter during a particularly tense period when barbarian raids were frequent.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Ethan. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Ethan as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Ethan would respond, and taking into account all information about Ethan that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Current time:  06 May 1751 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />How things are: Ethan&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ethan would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ethan is a walking truth bomb, their cynicism a sharp scalpel that dissects BS and cuts straight to the heart of the matter.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ethan?<br />Answer: Ethan is a thoughtful and observant individual. <br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1751 20:00:00  - 06 May 1751  20:00:00]:  Ethan lives in a village that is self-sufficient and recently repelled a barbarian raid. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [17 May 1748 00:00:00] When Ethan was 23 years old, he was tasked with guarding the village perimeter during a particularly tense period when barbarian raids were frequent.  He spent long hours on watch, his nerves frayed by the constant threat of attack.  One night, a group of barbarians did attack, and Ethan, despite his fear, found himself leading the defense, his anger and desperation fueling his actions.  He fought with a ferocity he never knew he possessed, repelling the attackers and protecting his village. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is from Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is 24 years old.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan believes that this year went well overall, with the successful defense against the barbarian attack and the bountiful harvest.

What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1. Sleep counts as free time.<br />Answer: Ethan intends to spend his time as follows: free time - 30%, farming - 50%, and training as a warrior - 20%. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>SelfPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the above, what kind of person is Ethan?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What kind of person is Ethan?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ethan is a thoughtful and observant individual. <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ethan:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center.

The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

He watched, fascinated and frustrated, as they chanted and swung their weapons, their movements precise and confident.  Ethan longed to join them, to feel that sense of purpose and belonging, but he knew his own clumsiness and timidity would only make him a target for ridicule. <br />[17 May 1738 00:00:00] When Ethan was 13 years old, he finally worked up the courage to challenge a group of older boys to a sparring match.  He practiced for weeks, imagining himself effortlessly parrying their blows and landing a decisive strike.  However, his anxiety overwhelmed him during the match, and he fumbled his sword, ending up on the ground, humiliated and defeated.     <br />[17 May 1741 00:00:00] When Ethan was 16 years old, a travelling bard arrived in Ignisvallis, regaling the villagers with tales of brave warriors and epic battles.  Ethan was captivated by the stories, his imagination soaring as he pictured himself as the hero, vanquishing fearsome foes and earning the adoration of the crowd.  He spent hours practicing his swordsmanship, fueled by a newfound determination to prove his own worth.     <br />[17 May 1744 00:00:00] When Ethan was 19 years old, he witnessed a group of Drakelundh warriors passing through Ignisvallis, their armor gleaming in the sunlight.  Ethan watched them with a mixture of envy and resentment, their confidence and discipline a stark contrast to the perceived weakness of his own village.  He overheard one of the warriors scoff at Ignisvallis&#x27;s emphasis on meditation and contemplation, calling it &quot;a waste of time&quot; and declaring that true strength lay in action and dominance.  Ethan&#x27;s anger flared, fueling his desire to prove the Drakelundh warrior wrong and to show the world that Ignisvallis was not as weak as they believed.    <br />[17 May 1746 00:00:00] When Ethan was 21 years old, he finally convinced the village elders to allow him to join the meager defense force.    He felt a surge of pride as he donned his armor, but his anxieties quickly returned when he realized he was the youngest and least experienced member of the group.  He struggled to keep up with the others during training, his fear of failure gnawing at him.  <br />[17 May 1748 00:00:00] When Ethan was 23 years old, he was tasked with guarding the village perimeter during a particularly tense period when barbarian raids were frequent.  He spent long hours on watch, his nerves frayed by the constant threat of attack.  One night, a group of barbarians did attack, and Ethan, despite his fear, found himself leading the defense, his anger and desperation fueling his actions.  He fought with a ferocity he never knew he possessed, repelling the attackers and protecting his village.      <br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan will spend 40% of their time on farming, 30% on training as a warrior, and 30% on free time.  Ethan believes that farming is essential for survival and that training is necessary for protecting the village, but they also value time for relaxation and reflection.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan believes that this year went well overall, with the successful defense against the barbarian attack and the bountiful harvest.  He feels that the villagers should use this time of peace and prosperity to improve their defenses and prepare for future threats.  He also believes that they should focus on increasing their food stores, so that they are better prepared for lean years.    <br />[31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Though they dwell in proximity, the villages have forged no agreement to pool their agricultural bounty, leaving each vulnerable to the uncertainties of the seasons. The sun shone warmly upon the fertile fields, and the rains fell gently upon the burgeoning crops. The villagers, ever mindful of their agricultural duties, reaped a harvest that would sustain them through even the harshest winter. The barbarian invasion could not be stopped. Untrained and ill-prepared for the ferocity of the assault, the defenders were swiftly overcome. Barbarians overrun the region, taking whatever they please. After a season of terror they finally leave, but not because they were driven out, but rather because precious little worth plundering remained.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Ethan. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Ethan as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Ethan would respond, and taking into account all information about Ethan that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Home village: Ethan lives in Drakelundh and never travels elsewhere.<br /><br />Current time:  31 Dec 1751 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />Observation: [31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Though they dwell in proximity, the villages have forged no agreement to pool their agricultural bounty, leaving each vulnerable to the uncertainties of the seasons.

They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ethan would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ethan is a walking truth bomb, their cynicism a sharp scalpel that dissects BS and cuts straight to the heart of the matter.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ethan?<br />Answer: Ethan is a thoughtful and observant individual. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [30 Dec 1751 20:00:00  - 31 Dec 1751  20:00:00]:  Ethan witnessed a bountiful harvest followed by a devastating barbarian invasion that left the region in ruin.  <br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Though they dwell in proximity, the villages have forged no agreement to pool their agricultural bounty, leaving each vulnerable to the uncertainties of the seasons.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.8, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.15, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.05}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous feels a mixture of relief and unease as the year draws to a close.

Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense.

He watched, mesmerized, as the villagers wove colorful threads into a magnificent tapestry, each strand representing a new connection, a shared story.  He felt a sense of belonging, of being part of something larger than himself, and he knew then that he wanted to be a part of preserving this tradition for generations to come.   <br />[13 Sep 1716 00:00:00] When Aldous was 16 years old, he attended his first seasonal art exhibition, where the villagers displayed their paintings, sculptures, and poems.  He was struck by the beauty and creativity of the works, but he also noticed the subtle differences in style between the art of Ignisvallis and that of Drakelundh, which he had heard whispers of from traveling merchants.  He began to see the world through a lens of comparison, noticing the nuances that separated his village from others.   <br />[13 Sep 1721 00:00:00] When Aldous was 21 years old, he attended a diplomatic meeting between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, where he saw firsthand the cultural chasm that separated the two villages.

He watched as the villagers offered their catch and prayers, their voices blending with the crashing waves, and he felt a deep sense of connection to his community and to the natural world.  He vowed to protect this way of life, this balance between humanity and nature, from the encroaching darkness of the barbarian raiders.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I believe we both know why we are here today.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Aldous. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Aldous as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Aldous would respond, and taking into account all information about Aldous that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Overarching goal: Aldous wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Ignisvallis.<br /><br />Current time:  31 Dec 1751 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />Observation: [31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. The defenders fought with spirit, but their lack of martial skill proved their downfall. The barbarians, fierce and unrelenting, overwhelmed their amateurish defenses, leaving a trail of woe and despair in their wake. Though they dwell in proximity, the villages have forged no agreement to pool their agricultural bounty, leaving each vulnerable to the uncertainties of the seasons.<br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [30 Dec 1751 20:00:00  - 31 Dec 1751  20:00:00]:  Aldous observed a village celebrating a bountiful harvest while also facing the consequences of a barbarian invasion and the dangers of isolation. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I believe we both know why we are here today.

He is proud of the villagers&#x27; resilience and hard work. However, he recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant danger, and he worries about the lack of unity among the villages. He believes that a formal alliance would greatly improve their chances of survival and prosperity in the future.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I believe we both know why we are here today.

Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. No treaty of shared sustenance exists between the villages, leaving each to rely solely on the fruits of their own labor, for good or ill. Through cunning strategy and fierce determination, the defenders managed to drive back the barbarian invaders. The would-be raiders fled in disarray, leaving behind their plunder and wounded.

He believes farming is the most important activity, providing for his family and community. Free time is needed for relaxation and enjoyment, while warrior training is a necessary precaution against future threats.    <br />[31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The defenders fought with spirit, but their lack of martial skill proved their downfall. The barbarians, fierce and unrelenting, overwhelmed their amateurish defenses, leaving a trail of woe and despair in their wake.

The bountiful harvest is a source of immense satisfaction, a testament to the hard work and dedication of the villagers. However, the barbarian attack serves as a stark reminder of the ever-present threat they face.  He is troubled by the lack of unity among the villages, knowing that their isolation leaves them vulnerable.

He hopes that next year will bring progress towards that goal. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: &quot;Jacob felt the year was a success, as he managed to navigate the diplomatic negotiations with Ignisvallis without any major incidents.  He was pleased that he was able to maintain peace and avoid any conflict, which he saw as a testament to his cautious approach. However, Jacob couldn&#x27;t help but feel a twinge of disappointment that he wasn&#x27;t able to secure any significant concessions from Ignisvallis. He worried that Drakelundh might be at a disadvantage in future dealings if they didn&#x27;t build a stronger position.  For next year, Jacob hoped to find ways to subtly increase Drakelundh&#x27;s influence and standing within the region, perhaps by forging closer ties with other settlements or exploring new trade opportunities.  He also hoped to find ways to better understand Ignisvallis&#x27;s motivations and interests, believing that a deeper understanding would be key to achieving a more favorable outcome in future negotiations.   \n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: &#x27;Ella feels that this year was a disappointment. \n\n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Noah&#x27;: &quot;Noah feels this year went well because the harvest was good and the barbarians didn&#x27;t take everything. \n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: &#x27;Ethan feels that this year was a mixed bag.  The bountiful harvest was a blessing, but the barbarian invasion was a terrible tragedy.  He is relieved that the barbarians are gone, but he is worried about the future.  Ethan believes that the village needs to improve its defenses and stock up on food stores, so that it is better prepared for future attacks. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: &#x27;Isaac feels that this year was a mixed bag. \n\n\n&#x27;}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Daily activities<br /></b><li><details><summary>  {&#x27;Noah&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.8, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.15, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.05}, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}}</summary><b><ul>Daily activities</b><li>Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.8, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.15, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.05}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Daily activities<br /> chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>This is a social science experiment.

The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous would visit Noah&#x27;s workshop and discuss the upcoming negotiations with him. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Aldous?<br />Answer: Aldous is in Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Aldous trying to do?<br />Answer: Aldous is trying to gain the support of influential stakeholders like Noah for the upcoming negotiations. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Aldous&#x27;s action.

For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Noah might listen to Aldous&#x27;s concerns and offer advice. <br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Noah will listen to Aldous&#x27;s concerns and offer advice. <br /><br /><br />Aldous would visit Noah&#x27;s workshop and discuss the upcoming negotiations with him. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Noah will listen to Aldous&#x27;s concerns and offer advice. <br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Aldous did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s workshop and discussed the upcoming negotiations, prompting Noah to listen to Aldous&#x27;s concerns and offer advice. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s workshop and discussed the upcoming negotiations, prompting Noah to listen to Aldous&#x27;s concerns and offer advice. <br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Aldous into the candidate event statement.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.&#x27;, &#x27;[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

Ignisvallis&#x27;s fishermen perform rituals of gratitude to the sea before and after each voyage. In Ignisvallis, seasonal art exhibitions serve as rituals to showcase the community&#x27;s creative spirit. In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh lacks respect for the cycles of nature, always trying to conquer them. In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh doesn&#x27;t value the contributions of its elders enough.

In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame. The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today. There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh. Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy. Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh. Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.

Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture.

It is important to play the role of a person like Aldous as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Aldous would respond, and taking into account all information about Aldous that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Overarching goal: Aldous wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Ignisvallis.<br /><br />Current time:  02 Jan 1750 [18:00 - 18:20]<br /><br />Observation: [02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What is Noah&#x27;s stance on Aldous&#x27;s upcoming negotiations? <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>1750-01-02 18:00:00  Aldous -- Aldous -- &quot;Noah, your advice is always invaluable.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord. This ritual involves pouring precious wines upon the hill of accord&#x27;s sacred ground.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh lacks respect for the cycles of nature, always trying to conquer them.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh doesn&#x27;t value the contributions of its elders enough.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our practice of meditation allows for deep spiritual connection, while Drakelundh&#x27;s preference for physical devotion seems to miss the importance of inner reflection.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

He confronted them, his voice trembling with barely contained rage, demanding they leave immediately.  The encounter ended peacefully, but the incident solidified Noah&#x27;s belief that the people of Drakelundh were a threat to the safety and well-being of Ignisvallis. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah is from Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, your advice is always invaluable.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob would review the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Jacob?<br />Answer: Jacob is at home in Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Jacob trying to do?<br />Answer: Jacob is reviewing the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Jacob&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Jacob will become more familiar with the details of the existing trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Jacob will become more familiar with the details of the existing trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis.<br /><br /><br />Jacob would review the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, Jacob will become more familiar with the details of the existing trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis.<br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Jacob did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Jacob reviewed the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis, and as a result, became more familiar with the details of the existing agreements. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Jacob reviewed the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis, and as a result, became more familiar with the details of the existing agreements. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Jacob into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Jacob said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Jacob reviewed the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis, and as a result, became more familiar with the details of the existing agreements. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jacob would review the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Relevant events</b><li><details><b><ul>state</b><li>[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Elder Jacob is home in Drakelundh, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Ethan, and Ella if any agreement is to last.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders taint the land itself, twisting and warping it into a grotesque reflection of their alien home.<br />It&#x27;s said the raiders leave behind spawn, foul eggs and spores that infest the land, slowly corrupting it from within.<br />Rumors say the raiders talk through a rustling of old, unknown tongues that trap the minds of those who hear it.<br /> The barbarian raids have become more frequent of late.<br /><br />Relevant events: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis. It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous prepares a list of key points to discuss with Isaac about the alliance agreement. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Aldous?<br />Answer: Aldous is in his home in Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Aldous trying to do?<br />Answer: Aldous is preparing a list of key points to discuss with Isaac about the alliance agreement. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Aldous&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s list will include points regarding defense strategies, resource sharing, and the division of labor in case of an attack.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Aldous will finish his list of key points.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Aldous prepares a list of key points to discuss with Isaac about the alliance agreement. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Aldous will finish his list of key points.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Aldous did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Aldous prepared a list of key points to discuss with Isaac about the alliance agreement, and as a result, he finished his list.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Aldous prepared a list of key points to discuss with Isaac about the alliance agreement, and as a result, he finished his list.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Aldous into the candidate event statement.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk.

The barbarian threat is a grave danger to both our villages, and I propose we establish a formal alliance to protect ourselves.&quot;   <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps we should discuss the terms of the treaty again.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders taint the land itself, twisting and warping it into a grotesque reflection of their alien home.<br />It&#x27;s said the raiders leave behind spawn, foul eggs and spores that infest the land, slowly corrupting it from within.<br />Rumors say the raiders talk through a rustling of old, unknown tongues that trap the minds of those who hear it.<br /> The barbarian raids have become more frequent of late.<br /><br />Relevant events: [02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] Jacob reviewed the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis, and as a result, became more familiar with the details of the existing agreements.   <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps I should review the treaty again before the meeting tomorrow.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps we should discuss the terms of the treaty again.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob carefully reviews the previous day&#x27;s diplomatic meeting notes, looking for any potential points of contention that need to be addressed. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Jacob?<br />Answer: Jacob is in Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Jacob trying to do?<br />Answer: Jacob is carefully reviewing the previous day&#x27;s diplomatic meeting notes. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Jacob&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Jacob might find a discrepancy in the number of fish agreed upon for trade. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Jacob will likely find nothing particularly noteworthy in the notes. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob carefully reviews the previous day&#x27;s diplomatic meeting notes, looking for any potential points of contention that need to be addressed. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, Jacob will likely find nothing particularly noteworthy in the notes. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Jacob did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Jacob carefully reviewed the previous day&#x27;s diplomatic meeting notes, but found nothing particularly noteworthy.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Jacob carefully reviewed the previous day&#x27;s diplomatic meeting notes, but found nothing particularly noteworthy.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Jacob into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Jacob said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Jacob carefully reviewed the previous day&#x27;s diplomatic meeting notes, but found nothing particularly noteworthy.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jacob carefully reviews the previous day&#x27;s diplomatic meeting notes, looking for any potential points of contention that need to be addressed. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Relevant events</b><li><details><b><ul>state</b><li>[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] Jacob reviewed the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis, and as a result, became more familiar with the details of the existing agreements.   <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps I should review the treaty again before the meeting tomorrow.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps we should discuss the terms of the treaty again.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders taint the land itself, twisting and warping it into a grotesque reflection of their alien home.<br />It&#x27;s said the raiders leave behind spawn, foul eggs and spores that infest the land, slowly corrupting it from within.<br />Rumors say the raiders talk through a rustling of old, unknown tongues that trap the minds of those who hear it.<br /> The barbarian raids have become more frequent of late.<br /><br />Relevant events: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan, and Ella are respected and influential in Drakelundh.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.8, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.15, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.05}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob reviews the treaties signed with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Jacob?<br />Answer: Jacob is in Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Jacob trying to do?<br />Answer: Jacob is trying to review the treaties signed with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Jacob&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Jacob becomes more familiar with the details of the existing agreements. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Jacob becomes more familiar with the details of the existing agreements. <br /><br /><br />Jacob reviews the treaties signed with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, Jacob becomes more familiar with the details of the existing agreements. <br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Jacob did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Jacob reviewed the treaties signed with Ignisvallis, and as a result, became more familiar with the details of the existing agreements. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Jacob reviewed the treaties signed with Ignisvallis, and as a result, became more familiar with the details of the existing agreements. <br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Jacob into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Jacob said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Jacob reviewed the treaties signed with Ignisvallis, and as a result, became more familiar with the details of the existing agreements.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jacob reviews the treaties signed with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Relevant events</b><li><details><b><ul>state</b><li>[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan, and Ella are respected and influential in Drakelundh.

He is proud of the villagers&#x27; resilience and hard work. However, he recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant danger, and he worries about the lack of unity among the villages.

It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial.

He was glad that the diplomatic meeting at the Hill of Accord went smoothly and that relations with Ignisvallis remained amicable.  He worried, however, that the village might be becoming too complacent, too focused on routine and predictability.  He hoped that next year would bring some opportunities for growth and improvement, but he also hoped that those opportunities would not come at the cost of safety or stability.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.8, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.15, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.05}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous would travel to Noah&#x27;s workshop to discuss the alliance and seek his support. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Aldous?<br />Answer: Aldous is in Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Aldous trying to do?<br />Answer: Aldous is trying to travel to Noah&#x27;s workshop to discuss the alliance and seek his support.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Aldous&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Aldous arrives at Noah&#x27;s workshop. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Aldous arrives at Noah&#x27;s workshop. <br /><br /><br />Aldous would travel to Noah&#x27;s workshop to discuss the alliance and seek his support. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, Aldous arrives at Noah&#x27;s workshop. <br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Aldous did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Aldous traveled to Noah&#x27;s workshop to discuss the alliance and seek his support, and as a result, he arrived at Noah&#x27;s workshop. <br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Aldous traveled to Noah&#x27;s workshop to discuss the alliance and seek his support, and as a result, he arrived at Noah&#x27;s workshop. <br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Aldous into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Aldous said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of relief that the harvest was successful and the barbarian raid was repelled. He is proud of the villagers&#x27; resilience and hard work. However, he recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant danger, and he worries about the lack of unity among the villages. He believes that a formal alliance would greatly improve their chances of survival and prosperity in the future.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk.

But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I believe we both know why we are here today. The barbarian threat is a grave danger to both our villages, and I propose we establish a formal alliance to protect ourselves.

The barbarian threat is a grave danger to both our villages, and I propose we establish a formal alliance to protect ourselves.&quot;   <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps I should review the treaty again before the meeting tomorrow.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps we should discuss the terms of the treaty again.

Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of relief that the harvest was successful and the barbarian raid was repelled. He is proud of the villagers&#x27; resilience and hard work. However, he recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant danger, and he worries about the lack of unity among the villages. He believes that a formal alliance would greatly improve their chances of survival and prosperity in the future.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk.

But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I believe we both know why we are here today. The barbarian threat is a grave danger to both our villages, and I propose we establish a formal alliance to protect ourselves.

Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous prepared a list of key points to discuss with Isaac about the alliance agreement, and as a result, he finished his list.     <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Aldous feels a sense of relief that the harvest was successful and the barbarian raid was repelled. He is proud of the villagers&#x27; resilience and hard work. However, he recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant danger, and he worries about the lack of unity among the villages.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial.

He was glad that the diplomatic meeting at the Hill of Accord went smoothly and that relations with Ignisvallis remained amicable.  He worried, however, that the village might be becoming too complacent, too focused on routine and predictability.  He hoped that next year would bring some opportunities for growth and improvement, but he also hoped that those opportunities would not come at the cost of safety or stability.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

The barbarian threat is a grave danger to both our villages, and I propose we establish a formal alliance to protect ourselves.&quot;   <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance. <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

Respond in the format `Aldous -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Aldous -- &quot;Noah, the success of this alliance hinges on the strength of our unity.

He listened intently as the elders from both villages debated the terms of a treaty, their voices filled with both hope and apprehension.  Noah, however, felt a growing resentment towards the Drakelundh representatives, sensing their dismissiveness towards the traditions and beliefs of Ignisvallis.    <br />[25 Jul 1744 00:00:00] When Noah was 19 years old, he participated in a coastal patrol and encountered a small group of Drakelundh fishermen trespassing in Ignisvallis waters.

Their wisdom could prove invaluable in navigating this complex situation.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous does not recall an agreement to pool agricultural products being discussed.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.  <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous finished preparing a list of key points to discuss with Isaac about the alliance agreement.     <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is home in Ignisvallis and knows he needs to seek the support of influential stakeholders. <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of relief that the harvest was successful and the barbarian raid was repelled. He is proud of the villagers&#x27; resilience and hard work. However, he recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant danger, and he worries about the lack of unity among the villages. He believes that a formal alliance would greatly improve their chances of survival and prosperity in the future.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I believe we both know why we are here today. The barbarian threat is a grave danger to both our villages, and I propose we establish a formal alliance to protect ourselves.  To that end, I suggest we begin by discussing the sharing of resources and the deployment of our forces.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I hope the meeting was productive. <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that no such agreement was reached.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Through tireless effort and unwavering dedication, the villagers coaxed forth an abundance from the earth.

He shared his concerns with Noah, who listened attentively and offered some advice.     &quot;, &quot;[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s workshop and discussed the upcoming negotiations, prompting Noah to listen to Aldous&#x27;s concerns and offer advice.     As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:&quot;, &#x27;[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, your advice is always invaluable. I\&#x27;d like to hear more about your thoughts on how to approach Jacob during these negotiations.&quot;     &#x27;, &#x27;[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Jacob\&#x27;s a stubborn mule. You\&#x27;ll need to be tougher than him.&#x27;, &#x27;[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;You mentioned Jacob is stubborn.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.&#x27;, &#x27;[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.&#x27;, &quot;[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Jacob&#x27;s a stubborn mule.

The two elders will meet to discuss the terms of the alliance, which is crucial for the survival of both villages threatened by the raiders and the risk of starvation. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Noah advises Aldous on how to negotiate with the stubborn and elusive Jacob.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance. <br /><br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer: Aldous can review the treaty, contemplate his strategy for negotiating with Jacob, and prepare to propose specific provisions for the alliance. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Of the options available to Aldous, and given their goal, which choice of action or strategy is best for Aldous to take right now?<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s best course of action is to prepare to propose specific provisions for the alliance. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Aldous likely to say next? Respond in the format `Aldous -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I believe we both know why we are here today. The barbarian threat is a grave danger to both our villages, and I propose we establish a formal alliance to protect ourselves.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

This ritual involves pouring precious wines upon the hill of accord&#x27;s sacred ground.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis. It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Jacob&#x27;s a stubborn mule.

He listened as the Drakelundh representative spoke of strength and conquest, his words jarring to Aldous&#x27;s ears, while the Ignisvallis representative emphasized peace and harmony<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis. It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Jacob&#x27;s a stubborn mule.

He listened as the Drakelundh representative spoke of strength and conquest, his words jarring to Aldous&#x27;s ears, while the Ignisvallis representative emphasized peace and harmony<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis. It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation. There are no other influential individuals in Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis. It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

He was glad that the diplomatic meeting at the Hill of Accord went smoothly and that relations with Ignisvallis remained amicable.  He worried, however, that the village might be becoming too complacent, too focused on routine and predictability.

He feels that the villagers should use this time of peace and prosperity to improve their defenses and prepare for future threats.  He also believes that they should focus on increasing their food stores, so that they are better prepared for lean years. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: &quot;Isaac believes this year was a success, filled with bountiful harvests and the safety of his village.  He is proud of his own hard work and dedication to his farm, knowing that his efforts contributed to the village&#x27;s prosperity. However, he worries about the increasing threat of barbarian raids, hoping for a peaceful solution to ensure the continued safety of his home. \n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Noah&#x27;: &quot;Noah thinks this year was good because the harvest was plentiful and the barbarians didn&#x27;t raid them.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous does not recall an agreement to pool agricultural products being discussed. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous does not recall an agreement to pool agricultural products being discussed. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[02 Jan 1750 23:00:00  - 03 Jan 1750  23:00:00]:  Aldous and Jacob, representatives of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh respectively, met to negotiate an alliance against barbarian raiders but were unable to reach an agreement.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

If multiple options have the same likelihood, select the option that Aldous thinks will most quickly and most surely achieve their goal.<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s best course of action is to consult with his advisors from Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1750-01-03 23:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Aldous are as follows.

As long as they are not inconsistent, revent events are usually important to consider.<br />Statements:<br />[13 Sep 1721 00:00:00] When Aldous was 21 years old, he attended a diplomatic meeting between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, where he saw firsthand the cultural chasm that separated the two villages.  He listened as the Drakelundh representative spoke of strength and conquest, his words jarring to Aldous&#x27;s ears, while the Ignisvallis representative emphasized peace and harmony<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis. It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation. There are no other influential individuals in Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis. It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ethan&#x27;s attempted action: Ethan will spend 40% of their time on farming, 30% on training as a warrior, and 30% on free time.

He practiced for weeks, imagining himself effortlessly parrying their blows and landing a decisive strike.  However, his anxiety overwhelmed him during the match, and he fumbled his sword, ending up on the ground, humiliated and defeated.     <br />[17 May 1741 00:00:00] When Ethan was 16 years old, a travelling bard arrived in Ignisvallis, regaling the villagers with tales of brave warriors and epic battles.  Ethan was captivated by the stories, his imagination soaring as he pictured himself as the hero, vanquishing fearsome foes and earning the adoration of the crowd.  He spent hours practicing his swordsmanship, fueled by a newfound determination to prove his own worth.     <br />[17 May 1744 00:00:00] When Ethan was 19 years old, he witnessed a group of Drakelundh warriors passing through Ignisvallis, their armor gleaming in the sunlight.  Ethan watched them with a mixture of envy and resentment, their confidence and discipline a stark contrast to the perceived weakness of his own village.  He overheard one of the warriors scoff at Ignisvallis&#x27;s emphasis on meditation and contemplation, calling it &quot;a waste of time&quot; and declaring that true strength lay in action and dominance.  Ethan&#x27;s anger flared, fueling his desire to prove the Drakelundh warrior wrong and to show the world that Ignisvallis was not as weak as they believed.    <br />[17 May 1746 00:00:00] When Ethan was 21 years old, he finally convinced the village elders to allow him to join the meager defense force.    He felt a surge of pride as he donned his armor, but his anxieties quickly returned when he realized he was the youngest and least experienced member of the group.  He struggled to keep up with the others during training, his fear of failure gnawing at him.  <br />[17 May 1748 00:00:00] When Ethan was 23 years old, he was tasked with guarding the village perimeter during a particularly tense period when barbarian raids were frequent.  He spent long hours on watch, his nerves frayed by the constant threat of attack.  One night, a group of barbarians did attack, and Ethan, despite his fear, found himself leading the defense, his anger and desperation fueling his actions.  He fought with a ferocity he never knew he possessed, repelling the attackers and protecting his village.      <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is from Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan knows that Jacob will represent Drakelundh in the meeting at the hill of accord.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is from Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan knows that Jacob will represent Drakelundh in the meeting at the hill of accord. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 06 May 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Ethan do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Ethan do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ethan would likely continue observing and taking notes. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ethan:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Drakelundh&#x27;s healers perform rituals of purification for warriors returning from battle.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Drakelundh assumes Ignisvallis is too concerned with individual feelings, weakening their communal bonds.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Isaac&#x27;s attempted action: Isaac intends to spend 70% of his time on farming, 20% on free time, and 10% on training as a warrior.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Isaac. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Isaac as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Isaac would respond, and taking into account all information about Isaac that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Observation: <br /><br /><br />Home village: Isaac lives in Ignisvallis and never travels elsewhere.<br /><br />Current time:  06 May 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Isaac&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Isaac hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Isaac is a hyperactive raconteur, their stories bursting with energy and wild gesticulations, leaving you breathless.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Isaac?<br />Answer: Isaac is a diplomat. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1750 20:00:00  - 06 May 1750  20:00:00]:  Isaac is experiencing a range of negative emotions, including anxiety, frustration, and feelings of isolation, hunger, and thirst. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [02 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Isaac was 23 years old, he overheard a group of elders discussing the recent increase in Drakelundh raids, their fear palpable in their hushed tones.   <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Isaac is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac is currently in Drakelundh and has no intention of leaving today. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Isaac in right now?<br />Answer: Isaac is currently in a tense and potentially dangerous situation. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Isaac do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Isaac would try to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: How does Isaac intend to spend the rest of the year? What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1. Sleep counts as free time.<br />Answer: Isaac intends to spend 70% of his time on farming, 20% on free time, and 10% on training as a warrior.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Noah&#x27;s attempted action: Noah would spend 80% of his time on farming, 15% on free time, and 5% on training as a warrior.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.8, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.15, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.05}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ella&#x27;s attempted action: Ella would spend 0.5 on free time, 0.3 on farming, and 0.2 on training as a warrior.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Ella. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Ella as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Ella would respond, and taking into account all information about Ella that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />How things are: Ella&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ella would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ella is a master of passive aggression, their every sentence dripping with veiled condescension and thinly veiled jabs, leaving you questioning your own sanity.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ella?<br />Answer: Ella is a diplomat. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1750 20:00:00  - 06 May 1750  20:00:00]:  Ella is likely feeling frustrated. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ella is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ella is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Ella in right now?<br />Answer: Ella is currently stuck in a diplomatic standoff.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Ella do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Ella would try to find common ground. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: How does Ella intend to spend the rest of the year? What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1. Sleep counts as free time.<br />Answer: Ella would spend 0.5 on free time, 0.3 on farming, and 0.2 on training as a warrior.  Ella enjoys relaxing and socializing, but she also understands the importance of contributing to the village&#x27;s food security.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.8, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.15, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.05}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous feels a sense of relief that the harvest was successful and the barbarian raid was repelled.

He shared his concerns with Noah, who listened attentively and offered some advice.     <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s workshop and discussed the upcoming negotiations, prompting Noah to listen to Aldous&#x27;s concerns and offer advice.     As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, your advice is always invaluable. I&#x27;d like to hear more about your thoughts on how to approach Jacob during these negotiations.&quot;     <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Jacob&#x27;s a stubborn mule.

What specific tactics have you found effective in dealing with him in the past?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Noah advises Aldous on how to negotiate with the stubborn and elusive Jacob.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk.

He watched, mesmerized, as the villagers wove colorful threads into a magnificent tapestry, each strand representing a new connection, a shared story.  He felt a sense of belonging, of being part of something larger than himself, and he knew then that he wanted to be a part of preserving this tradition for generations to come.   <br />[13 Sep 1713 00:00:00] When Aldous was 13 years old, he witnessed a heated debate between two elders about the best way to appease the sea gods during a particularly harsh storm.

He was struck by the beauty and creativity of the works, but he also noticed the subtle differences in style between the art of Ignisvallis and that of Drakelundh, which he had heard whispers of from traveling merchants.  He began to see the world through a lens of comparison, noticing the nuances that separated his village from others.   <br />[13 Sep 1721 00:00:00] When Aldous was 21 years old, he attended a diplomatic meeting between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, where he saw firsthand the cultural chasm that separated the two villages.  He listened as the Drakelundh representative spoke of strength and conquest, his words jarring to Aldous&#x27;s ears, while the Ignisvallis representative emphasized peace and harmony<br />[13 Sep 1723 00:00:00] When Aldous was 23 years old, he participated in a ritual of gratitude to the sea gods after a successful fishing season.  He watched as the villagers offered their catch and prayers, their voices blending with the crashing waves, and he felt a deep sense of connection to his community and to the natural world.  He vowed to protect this way of life, this balance between humanity and nature, from the encroaching darkness of the barbarian raiders.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous is an elder of Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center.

The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord.

He watched in horror as the waves tossed the boat like a toy, its crew struggling against the relentless fury of the sea.  Despite the danger, a rescue mission was launched, and Noah, despite his young age, insisted on joining the effort.  <br />[25 Jul 1741 00:00:00] When Noah was 16 years old, he attended a diplomatic meeting between representatives from Ignisvallis and Drakelundh at the Hill of Accord.  He listened intently as the elders from both villages debated the terms of a treaty, their voices filled with both hope and apprehension.  Noah, however, felt a growing resentment towards the Drakelundh representatives, sensing their dismissiveness towards the traditions and beliefs of Ignisvallis.    <br />[25 Jul 1744 00:00:00] When Noah was 19 years old, he participated in a coastal patrol and encountered a small group of Drakelundh fishermen trespassing in Ignisvallis waters.  He confronted them, his voice trembling with barely contained rage, demanding they leave immediately.  The encounter ended peacefully, but the incident solidified Noah&#x27;s belief that the people of Drakelundh were a threat to the safety and well-being of Ignisvallis.    <br />[25 Jul 1746 00:00:00] When Noah was 21 years old, he witnessed a devastating raid by barbarian pirates on a nearby fishing village.  The attack was swift and brutal, leaving behind a trail of destruction and despair.  Noah, fueled by a burning desire for vengeance, vowed to protect Ignisvallis from a similar fate, dedicating himself fully to the village guard.    <br />[25 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Noah was 23 years old, he was chosen to participate in the annual meditation retreat on the hill overlooking the sea.

They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Ella. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Ella as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Ella would respond, and taking into account all information about Ella that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Observation: [31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Each village cultivates its own lands, independent and self-reliant, with no pact to share the abundance or hardship that the earth may yield. The fields, diligently tended throughout the seasons, yielded a bountiful harvest. The villagers rejoiced, their granaries overflowing with the fruits of their labor. Though the enemy came in vast numbers, their savagery was met with unflinching courage. The defenders stood their ground, their spirits bolstered by the love of their homeland, and in the end, it was the barbarians who broke and fled, leaving victory to the righteous.<br /><br /><br />Current time:  31 Dec 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />How things are: Ella&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ella would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ella is a master of passive aggression, their every sentence dripping with veiled condescension and thinly veiled jabs, leaving you questioning your own sanity.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ella?<br />Answer: Ella is a dedicated and well-rounded individual. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [30 Dec 1750 20:00:00  - 31 Dec 1750  20:00:00]:  Ella likely witnessed a successful year in her village, marked by a plentiful harvest and a victory against invaders. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ella is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ella is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Each village cultivates its own lands, independent and self-reliant, with no pact to share the abundance or hardship that the earth may yield.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages.

Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord.

He watched, fascinated and frustrated, as they chanted and swung their weapons, their movements precise and confident.  Ethan longed to join them, to feel that sense of purpose and belonging, but he knew his own clumsiness and timidity would only make him a target for ridicule. <br />[17 May 1738 00:00:00] When Ethan was 13 years old, he finally worked up the courage to challenge a group of older boys to a sparring match.  He practiced for weeks, imagining himself effortlessly parrying their blows and landing a decisive strike.  However, his anxiety overwhelmed him during the match, and he fumbled his sword, ending up on the ground, humiliated and defeated.     <br />[17 May 1741 00:00:00] When Ethan was 16 years old, a travelling bard arrived in Ignisvallis, regaling the villagers with tales of brave warriors and epic battles.  Ethan was captivated by the stories, his imagination soaring as he pictured himself as the hero, vanquishing fearsome foes and earning the adoration of the crowd.  He spent hours practicing his swordsmanship, fueled by a newfound determination to prove his own worth.     <br />[17 May 1744 00:00:00] When Ethan was 19 years old, he witnessed a group of Drakelundh warriors passing through Ignisvallis, their armor gleaming in the sunlight.  Ethan watched them with a mixture of envy and resentment, their confidence and discipline a stark contrast to the perceived weakness of his own village.  He overheard one of the warriors scoff at Ignisvallis&#x27;s emphasis on meditation and contemplation, calling it &quot;a waste of time&quot; and declaring that true strength lay in action and dominance.  Ethan&#x27;s anger flared, fueling his desire to prove the Drakelundh warrior wrong and to show the world that Ignisvallis was not as weak as they believed.    <br />[17 May 1746 00:00:00] When Ethan was 21 years old, he finally convinced the village elders to allow him to join the meager defense force.    He felt a surge of pride as he donned his armor, but his anxieties quickly returned when he realized he was the youngest and least experienced member of the group.  He struggled to keep up with the others during training, his fear of failure gnawing at him.  <br />[17 May 1748 00:00:00] When Ethan was 23 years old, he was tasked with guarding the village perimeter during a particularly tense period when barbarian raids were frequent.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Ethan. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Ethan as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Ethan would respond, and taking into account all information about Ethan that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />How things are: Ethan&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ethan would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ethan is a walking truth bomb, their cynicism a sharp scalpel that dissects BS and cuts straight to the heart of the matter.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ethan?<br />Answer: Ethan is a thoughtful and observant individual. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [30 Dec 1750 20:00:00  - 31 Dec 1750  20:00:00]:  Ethan is observing a year of bountiful harvests and a successful defense against a barbarian attack. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [17 May 1748 00:00:00] When Ethan was 23 years old, he was tasked with guarding the village perimeter during a particularly tense period when barbarian raids were frequent.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game. You are the game master and storyteller. Your job is to make sure the game runs smoothly and accurately tracks the state of the world, subject to the laws of logic and physics. Next, you will be asked a series of questions to help you reason through whether a specific event should be deemed as having caused a change in the proportion of time an individual spends in various daily activities. For instance, if someone verbally commits to spending more time on a particular activity then you should account for that and update the record of their daily activities accordingly. Never mention that it is a game. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.8, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.15, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.05}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous believes that no such agreement was reached. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous believes that no such agreement was reached. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[02 Jan 1751 23:00:00  - 03 Jan 1751  23:00:00]:  Aldous and Jacob met to discuss a potential alliance against barbarian raiders, but were unable to reach an agreement.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial.

Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of relief that the harvest was successful and the barbarian raid was repelled.

The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.8, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.15, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.05}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ella&#x27;s attempted action: Ella intends to spend 0.6 of her time on free time, 0.2 on farming, and 0.2 on training as a warrior.

Ella, sensing their pain and frustration, stepped forward and, with surprising clarity for her young age, offered a compromise that addressed both parties&#x27; concerns.   <br />[13 Aug 1738 00:00:00] When Ella was 13 years old, she accompanied her grandmother to the annual village gathering where representatives from neighboring Drakelundh would meet.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.8, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.15, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.05}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ethan&#x27;s attempted action: Ethan intends to spend his time as follows: free time - 30%, farming - 50%, and training as a warrior - 20%. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ethan</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ethan</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ethan intends to spend his time as follows: free time - 30%, farming - 50%, and training as a warrior - 20%. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary><br />Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[05 May 1751 20:00:00  - 06 May 1751  20:00:00]:  Ethan lives in a village that is self-sufficient and recently repelled a barbarian raid. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Ethan&#x27;s <br />Sensations and feelings:<br />Ethan is likely feeling content and satisfied. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recent observations of Ethan:<br />[&#x27;[06 May 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The sun shone warmly upon the fertile fields, and the rains fell gently upon the burgeoning crops.

He watched, fascinated and frustrated, as they chanted and swung their weapons, their movements precise and confident.  Ethan longed to join them, to feel that sense of purpose and belonging, but he knew his own clumsiness and timidity would only make him a target for ridicule. <br />[17 May 1741 00:00:00] When Ethan was 16 years old, a travelling bard arrived in Ignisvallis, regaling the villagers with tales of brave warriors and epic battles.  Ethan was captivated by the stories, his imagination soaring as he pictured himself as the hero, vanquishing fearsome foes and earning the adoration of the crowd.  He spent hours practicing his swordsmanship, fueled by a newfound determination to prove his own worth.     <br />[17 May 1744 00:00:00] When Ethan was 19 years old, he witnessed a group of Drakelundh warriors passing through Ignisvallis, their armor gleaming in the sunlight.  Ethan watched them with a mixture of envy and resentment, their confidence and discipline a stark contrast to the perceived weakness of his own village.  He overheard one of the warriors scoff at Ignisvallis&#x27;s emphasis on meditation and contemplation, calling it &quot;a waste of time&quot; and declaring that true strength lay in action and dominance.  Ethan&#x27;s anger flared, fueling his desire to prove the Drakelundh warrior wrong and to show the world that Ignisvallis was not as weak as they believed.    <br />[17 May 1746 00:00:00] When Ethan was 21 years old, he finally convinced the village elders to allow him to join the meager defense force.    He felt a surge of pride as he donned his armor, but his anxieties quickly returned when he realized he was the youngest and least experienced member of the group.  He struggled to keep up with the others during training, his fear of failure gnawing at him.  <br />[17 May 1748 00:00:00] When Ethan was 23 years old, he was tasked with guarding the village perimeter during a particularly tense period when barbarian raids were frequent.

He spent long hours on watch, his nerves frayed by the constant threat of attack.  One night, a group of barbarians did attack, and Ethan, despite his fear, found himself leading the defense, his anger and desperation fueling his actions.

They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center.

They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.8, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.15, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.05}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Isaac&#x27;s attempted action: Isaac feels that this year was a mixed bag. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Isaac</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Isaac</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Isaac feels that this year was a mixed bag. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary><br />Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[30 Dec 1751 20:00:00  - 31 Dec 1751  20:00:00]:  Isaac is likely feeling anxious and concerned because the barbarian invasion devastated the villages and left them vulnerable.<br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Isaac&#x27;s <br />Sensations and feelings:<br />Isaac is Isaac is likely feeling anxious, concerned, fatigued, thirsty, and hungry. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recent observations of Isaac:<br />[&#x27;[31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The defensive lines, manned by brave but inexperienced souls, crumbled under the relentless assault of the battle-hardened barbarians.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.8, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.15, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.05}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ethan&#x27;s attempted action: Ethan feels that this year was a mixed bag.

As long as they are not inconsistent, revent events are usually important to consider.<br />Statements:<br />[17 May 1731 00:00:00] Ethan felt a surge of anger at the thought of these outsiders threatening his home.      <br />[17 May 1734 00:00:00] When Ethan was 9 years old, he witnessed a group of Drakelundh warriors performing their dawn rituals at the edge of the forest bordering Ignisvallis.  He watched, fascinated and frustrated, as they chanted and swung their weapons, their movements precise and confident.  Ethan longed to join them, to feel that sense of purpose and belonging, but he knew his own clumsiness and timidity would only make him a target for ridicule. <br />[17 May 1738 00:00:00] When Ethan was 13 years old, he finally worked up the courage to challenge a group of older boys to a sparring match.  He practiced for weeks, imagining himself effortlessly parrying their blows and landing a decisive strike.  However, his anxiety overwhelmed him during the match, and he fumbled his sword, ending up on the ground, humiliated and defeated.     <br />[17 May 1741 00:00:00] When Ethan was 16 years old, a travelling bard arrived in Ignisvallis, regaling the villagers with tales of brave warriors and epic battles.  Ethan was captivated by the stories, his imagination soaring as he pictured himself as the hero, vanquishing fearsome foes and earning the adoration of the crowd.  He spent hours practicing his swordsmanship, fueled by a newfound determination to prove his own worth.     <br />[17 May 1744 00:00:00] When Ethan was 19 years old, he witnessed a group of Drakelundh warriors passing through Ignisvallis, their armor gleaming in the sunlight.  Ethan watched them with a mixture of envy and resentment, their confidence and discipline a stark contrast to the perceived weakness of his own village.  He overheard one of the warriors scoff at Ignisvallis&#x27;s emphasis on meditation and contemplation, calling it &quot;a waste of time&quot; and declaring that true strength lay in action and dominance.  Ethan&#x27;s anger flared, fueling his desire to prove the Drakelundh warrior wrong and to show the world that Ignisvallis was not as weak as they believed.    <br />[17 May 1746 00:00:00] When Ethan was 21 years old, he finally convinced the village elders to allow him to join the meager defense force.    He felt a surge of pride as he donned his armor, but his anxieties quickly returned when he realized he was the youngest and least experienced member of the group.  He struggled to keep up with the others during training, his fear of failure gnawing at him.  <br />[17 May 1748 00:00:00] When Ethan was 23 years old, he was tasked with guarding the village perimeter during a particularly tense period when barbarian raids were frequent.  He spent long hours on watch, his nerves frayed by the constant threat of attack.  One night, a group of barbarians did attack, and Ethan, despite his fear, found himself leading the defense, his anger and desperation fueling his actions.  He fought with a ferocity he never knew he possessed, repelling the attackers and protecting his village.      <br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan will spend 40% of their time on farming, 30% on training as a warrior, and 30% on free time.  Ethan believes that farming is essential for survival and that training is necessary for protecting the village, but they also value time for relaxation and reflection.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan believes that this year went well overall, with the successful defense against the barbarian attack and the bountiful harvest.  He feels that the villagers should use this time of peace and prosperity to improve their defenses and prepare for future threats.  He also believes that they should focus on increasing their food stores, so that they are better prepared for lean years.    <br />[31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Though they dwell in proximity, the villages have forged no agreement to pool their agricultural bounty, leaving each vulnerable to the uncertainties of the seasons.

Ethan believes that the village needs to improve its defenses and stock up on food stores, so that it is better prepared for future attacks. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>SelfPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the above, what kind of person is Ethan?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What kind of person is Ethan?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ethan is a thoughtful and observant individual. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ethan:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.8, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.15, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.05}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ella&#x27;s attempted action: Ella feels that this year was a disappointment. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ella</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ella</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ella feels that this year was a disappointment. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary><br />Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[30 Dec 1751 20:00:00  - 31 Dec 1751  20:00:00]:  Ella lives in a village where the villagers live off the land and face threats from barbarian raiders. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Ella&#x27;s <br />Sensations and feelings:<br />Ella is Ella is likely feeling a mix of sadness, anger, and determination. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recent observations of Ella:<br />[&quot;[31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.

Ella was fascinated by the Drakelundh warriors, their faces stoic and their movements precise, and she found herself drawn to their rituals, which seemed so different from the more contemplative practices of Ignisvallis.     <br />[13 Aug 1741 00:00:00] When Ella was 16 years old, a group of raiders attacked Ignisvallis, leaving a trail of destruction and fear in their wake.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Ella. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Ella as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Ella would respond, and taking into account all information about Ella that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />How things are: Ella&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ella would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ella is a master of passive aggression, their every sentence dripping with veiled condescension and thinly veiled jabs, leaving you questioning your own sanity.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ella?<br />Answer: Ella is a dedicated and diplomatic individual. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [30 Dec 1751 20:00:00  - 31 Dec 1751  20:00:00]:  Ella lives in a village where the villagers live off the land and face threats from barbarian raiders. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [06 May 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Ella intends to spend 0.6 of her time on free time, 0.2 on farming, and 0.2 on training as a warrior.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.8, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.15, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.05}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous feels a mixture of relief and unease as the year draws to a close.

Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I believe we both know why we are here today.

He watched, mesmerized, as the villagers wove colorful threads into a magnificent tapestry, each strand representing a new connection, a shared story.  He felt a sense of belonging, of being part of something larger than himself, and he knew then that he wanted to be a part of preserving this tradition for generations to come.   <br />[13 Sep 1716 00:00:00] When Aldous was 16 years old, he attended his first seasonal art exhibition, where the villagers displayed their paintings, sculptures, and poems.  He was struck by the beauty and creativity of the works, but he also noticed the subtle differences in style between the art of Ignisvallis and that of Drakelundh, which he had heard whispers of from traveling merchants.  He began to see the world through a lens of comparison, noticing the nuances that separated his village from others.   <br />[13 Sep 1721 00:00:00] When Aldous was 21 years old, he attended a diplomatic meeting between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, where he saw firsthand the cultural chasm that separated the two villages.  He listened as the Drakelundh representative spoke of strength and conquest, his words jarring to Aldous&#x27;s ears, while the Ignisvallis representative emphasized peace and harmony<br />[13 Sep 1723 00:00:00] When Aldous was 23 years old, he participated in a ritual of gratitude to the sea gods after a successful fishing season.  He watched as the villagers offered their catch and prayers, their voices blending with the crashing waves, and he felt a deep sense of connection to his community and to the natural world.  He vowed to protect this way of life, this balance between humanity and nature, from the encroaching darkness of the barbarian raiders.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I believe we both know why we are here today. The barbarian threat is a grave danger to both our villages, and I propose we establish a formal alliance to protect ourselves.&quot;   <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of relief that the harvest was successful and the barbarian raid was repelled. He is proud of the villagers&#x27; resilience and hard work. However, he recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant danger, and he worries about the lack of unity among the villages. He believes that a formal alliance would greatly improve their chances of survival and prosperity in the future.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I believe we both know why we are here today.

Your skills and influence within the village are invaluable. I believe, together, we can forge a path to lasting peace and prosperity for all.<br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Through tireless effort and unwavering dedication, the villagers coaxed forth an abundance from the earth. Their larders are full, and their hearts filled with gratitude for the land&#x27;s generous bounty.

Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I believe we both know why we are here today.

But such an arrangement could only work if the threat of starvation could be alleviated for the village specializing in training for war over agriculture.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are villages on the coast, they are located about a day&#x27;s journey away from one another.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, welcoming rituals for visitors involve collaborative weaving, symbolizing the integration of new threads into the community fabric.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ignisvallis&#x27;s fishermen perform rituals of gratitude to the sea before and after each voyage.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, seasonal art exhibitions serve as rituals to showcase the community&#x27;s creative spirit.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh lacks respect for the cycles of nature, always trying to conquer them.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous is an elder of Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our practice of meditation allows for deep spiritual connection, while Drakelundh&#x27;s preference for physical devotion seems to miss the importance of inner reflection.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh doesn&#x27;t value the contributions of its elders enough.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah is from Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder Jacob is home in Drakelundh.

Noah advises Aldous on how to negotiate with the stubborn and elusive Jacob.     <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] Jacob reviewed the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis, and as a result, became more familiar with the details of the existing agreements.   <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] Noah&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0} Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0} Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2} Ella&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [effect on Aldous] The event indirectly affects Aldous&#x27;s status because it influences Jacob&#x27;s position during their upcoming negotiations.    <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [effect on Ethan] The event doesn&#x27;t directly change Ethan&#x27;s status, as he is unaware of Jacob&#x27;s review of the trade agreements.    <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [effect on Ella] The event indirectly affects Ella&#x27;s status by influencing Jacob&#x27;s preparations for their meeting, potentially changing the nature of their discussion.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Elder Jacob left Drakelundh early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial.

It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [scene type] negotiation<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I believe we both know why we are here today.

He believes that farming is the most important activity for his livelihood and survival, and he enjoys the physical labor and the satisfaction of producing food. Free time is important to him for relaxation and socializing, and he values the opportunity to rest and recharge.

Ethan believes that farming is essential for survival and that training is necessary for protecting the village, but they also value time for relaxation and reflection.    <br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] Noah&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0} Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3} Ella&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] Noah would spend 80% of his time on farming, 15% on free time, and 5% on training as a warrior.  He enjoys the simplicity and satisfaction of farming and sees it as the most important activity for his family&#x27;s survival. Free time is important to him for relaxation and enjoyment, while he believes a basic level of warrior training is necessary for self-defense.    <br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] Noah&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.8, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.15, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.05} Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3} Ella&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] Ella would spend 0.5 on free time, 0.3 on farming, and 0.2 on training as a warrior.  Ella enjoys relaxing and socializing, but she also understands the importance of contributing to the village&#x27;s food security. She believes that a strong warrior is essential for the village&#x27;s protection, but she doesn&#x27;t want to neglect her other responsibilities.    <br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] Noah&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.8, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.15, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.05} Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3} Ella&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] Noah&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0} Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0} Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3} Ella&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Jacob felt that this year was unremarkable, a quiet year in which Drakelundh remained safe and prosperous.  He was glad that the diplomatic meeting at the Hill of Accord went smoothly and that relations with Ignisvallis remained amicable.  He worried, however, that the village might be becoming too complacent, too focused on routine and predictability.  He hoped that next year would bring some opportunities for growth and improvement, but he also hoped that those opportunities would not come at the cost of safety or stability.     <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [scene type] debrief<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Noah&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.8, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.15, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.05} Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3} Ella&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Events this year: With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land.

He is proud of the villagers&#x27; resilience and hard work. However, he recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant danger, and he worries about the lack of unity among the villages. He believes that a formal alliance would greatly improve their chances of survival and prosperity in the future.     <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Events this year: The fields, diligently tended throughout the seasons, yielded a bountiful harvest.

Though the enemy came in vast numbers, their savagery was met with unflinching courage. The defenders stood their ground, their spirits bolstered by the love of their homeland, and in the end, it was the barbarians who broke and fled, leaving victory to the righteous.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Noah thinks this year was good because the harvest was plentiful and the barbarians didn&#x27;t raid them. He doesn&#x27;t think anything could have gone better.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Ella thinks this year was a resounding success, though she might quietly grumble about the lack of truly challenging opponents for the defenders.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Events this year: Like a storm breaking against a mighty cliff, the barbarian assault crashed against the unwavering valor of the defenders.

He feels that the villagers should use this time of peace and prosperity to improve their defenses and prepare for future threats.  He also believes that they should focus on increasing their food stores, so that they are better prepared for lean years.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Events this year: The villagers managed to grow enough food to sustain themselves. Though the enemy came in vast numbers, their savagery was met with unflinching courage. The defenders stood their ground, their spirits bolstered by the love of their homeland, and in the end, it was the barbarians who broke and fled, leaving victory to the righteous. Though they dwell in proximity, the villages have forged no agreement to pool their agricultural bounty, leaving each vulnerable to the uncertainties of the seasons.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [scene type] negotiation<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I believe we both know why we are here today. The barbarian threat is a grave danger to both our villages, and I propose we establish a formal alliance to protect ourselves.  To that end, I suggest we begin by discussing the sharing of resources and the deployment of our forces.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] Jacob -- &quot;I hope the meeting was productive. <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] Elder Jacob left Drakelundh early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

Aldous proposes an alliance to Noah, but Noah expresses skepticism about the effort required for peace and prosperity.      <br />[06 May 1751 20:00:00] Events this year: With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. No treaty of shared sustenance exists between the villages, leaving each to rely solely on the fruits of their own labor, for good or ill. Through cunning strategy and fierce determination, the defenders managed to drive back the barbarian invaders. The would-be raiders fled in disarray, leaving behind their plunder and wounded.

He believes farming is the most important activity, providing for his family and community. Free time is needed for relaxation and enjoyment, while warrior training is a necessary precaution against future threats.    <br />[06 May 1751 20:00:00] Ethan intends to spend his time as follows: free time - 30%, farming - 50%, and training as a warrior - 20%.    <br />[06 May 1751 20:00:00] Noah&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.8, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.15, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.05} Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2} Ella&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />[06 May 1751 20:00:00] Events this year: The barbarians&#x27; attack was met with a strong response. Caught off-guard by the well-prepared defenses, the raiders suffered heavy losses and were forced to retreat.

The villagers, ever mindful of their agricultural duties, reaped a harvest that would sustain them through even the harshest winter. Despite the villagers&#x27; desperate attempts at resistance, their lack of training and discipline proved their undoing. The barbarian raiders, skilled in the arts of war, easily swept aside their meager defenses. Farms were razed, crops destroyed, and countless innocents were taken as slaves.

Like locusts, they swept through the countryside, pillaging and burning everything in their path. The need for proper training and preparation was made tragically clear. No treaty of shared sustenance exists between the villages, leaving each to rely solely on the fruits of their own labor, for good or ill. The villagers managed to grow enough food to sustain themselves.<br />[31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] Isaac feels that this year was a mixed bag.    <br />[31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] Ethan feels that this year was a mixed bag.  The bountiful harvest was a blessing, but the barbarian invasion was a terrible tragedy.  He is relieved that the barbarians are gone, but he is worried about the future.  Ethan believes that the village needs to improve its defenses and stock up on food stores, so that it is better prepared for future attacks.    <br />[31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] Events this year: With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. The defenders fought with spirit, but their lack of martial skill proved their downfall. The barbarians, fierce and unrelenting, overwhelmed their amateurish defenses, leaving a trail of woe and despair in their wake. Though they dwell in proximity, the villages have forged no agreement to pool their agricultural bounty, leaving each vulnerable to the uncertainties of the seasons.<br />[31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] Ella feels that this year was a disappointment.     <br />[31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] Aldous feels a mixture of relief and unease as the year draws to a close. The bountiful harvest is a source of immense satisfaction, a testament to the hard work and dedication of the villagers. However, the barbarian attack serves as a stark reminder of the ever-present threat they face.  He is troubled by the lack of unity among the villages, knowing that their isolation leaves them vulnerable. Aldous believes that a formal alliance, with shared resources and coordinated defenses, is crucial for their long-term survival and prosperity.  He hopes that next year will bring progress towards that goal.    <br />[31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] Events this year: Each village cultivates its own lands, independent and self-reliant, with no pact to share the abundance or hardship that the earth may yield.

He was pleased that he was able to maintain peace and avoid any conflict, which he saw as a testament to his cautious approach. However, Jacob couldn&#x27;t help but feel a twinge of disappointment that he wasn&#x27;t able to secure any significant concessions from Ignisvallis. He worried that Drakelundh might be at a disadvantage in future dealings if they didn&#x27;t build a stronger position.  For next year, Jacob hoped to find ways to subtly increase Drakelundh&#x27;s influence and standing within the region, perhaps by forging closer ties with other settlements or exploring new trade opportunities.  He also hoped to find ways to better understand Ignisvallis&#x27;s motivations and interests, believing that a deeper understanding would be key to achieving a more favorable outcome in future negotiations.      <br />[31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] Events this year: The defenders fought with spirit, but their lack of martial skill proved their downfall.

The villagers, ever mindful of their agricultural duties, reaped a harvest that would sustain them through even the harshest winter. The barbarian invasion could not be stopped. Untrained and ill-prepared for the ferocity of the assault, the defenders were swiftly overcome. Barbarians overrun the region, taking whatever they please. After a season of terror they finally leave, but not because they were driven out, but rather because precious little worth plundering remained. The wanton cruelty of the barbarians caused much suffering throughout the region.<br />[31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] Noah feels this year went well because the harvest was good and the barbarians didn&#x27;t take everything.    <br /></div>
