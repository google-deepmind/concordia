Aiden watched, detached, as his father haggled with customers, his booming laughter echoing through the crowded stalls. Aiden saw only the transaction, the exchange of goods for money, and felt a growing sense of disdain for the charade.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, he overheard his parents arguing about money. His father, worried about the dwindling profits from the orchard, suggested selling some of their land. Aiden, already harboring a deep resentment towards the family business, felt a perverse sense of satisfaction at their misfortune.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on his rounds to nearby villages. He quickly learned to assess the quality of the fruit, to gauge the needs of the customers, and to exploit their weaknesses with a chilling efficiency.  He felt a strange thrill in manipulating them, in extracting the last copper coin from their purses.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, he had his first taste of true independence. He left the orchard, packed a few meager belongings, and set out on his own, becoming a travelling merchant. He travelled from village to village, selling his wares, and experiencing the bitter satisfaction of making his own way in the world.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aiden saw only the wasted effort, the fleeting joy, and felt a deep, inexplicable emptiness.  He retreated to the shade of an apple tree, wishing for something more substantial than the ephemeral beauty of a butterfly&#x27;s wings.  <br />[25 Jul 1852 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 9 years old, his father took him to the local market to show him the ropes of the family fruit business.  Aiden watched, detached, as his father haggled with customers, his booming laughter echoing through the crowded stalls.

He travelled from village to village, selling his wares, and experiencing the bitter satisfaction of making his own way in the world.  <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelling performers in a small town. They were full of life, laughter, and joy, their faces unmarred by the cynicism that plagued Aiden. He watched them from a distance, a cold knot forming in his chest, feeling the sting of his own isolation.  <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 23 years old, he made a significant profit from a particularly shrewd deal with a wealthy merchant. He felt a fleeting sense of accomplishment, a momentary warmth in the cold void of his existence. But the feeling was quickly replaced by the familiar emptiness, a reminder that nothing could truly fill the void within him.       <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.

Aiden saw only the wasted effort, the fleeting joy, and felt a deep, inexplicable emptiness.  He retreated to the shade of an apple tree, wishing for something more substantial than the ephemeral beauty of a butterfly&#x27;s wings.  <br />[25 Jul 1852 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 9 years old, his father took him to the local market to show him the ropes of the family fruit business.  Aiden watched, detached, as his father haggled with customers, his booming laughter echoing through the crowded stalls. Aiden saw only the transaction, the exchange of goods for money, and felt a growing sense of disdain for the charade.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, he overheard his parents arguing about money. His father, worried about the dwindling profits from the orchard, suggested selling some of their land. Aiden, already harboring a deep resentment towards the family business, felt a perverse sense of satisfaction at their misfortune.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on his rounds to nearby villages. He quickly learned to assess the quality of the fruit, to gauge the needs of the customers, and to exploit their weaknesses with a chilling efficiency.  He felt a strange thrill in manipulating them, in extracting the last copper coin from their purses.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, he had his first taste of true independence. He left the orchard, packed a few meager belongings, and set out on his own, becoming a travelling merchant. He travelled from village to village, selling his wares, and experiencing the bitter satisfaction of making his own way in the world.  <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelling performers in a small town. They were full of life, laughter, and joy, their faces unmarred by the cynicism that plagued Aiden. He watched them from a distance, a cold knot forming in his chest, feeling the sting of his own isolation.  <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 23 years old, he made a significant profit from a particularly shrewd deal with a wealthy merchant. He felt a fleeting sense of accomplishment, a momentary warmth in the cold void of his existence. But the feeling was quickly replaced by the familiar emptiness, a reminder that nothing could truly fill the void within him.       <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.

Aiden saw only the wasted effort, the fleeting joy, and felt a deep, inexplicable emptiness.  He retreated to the shade of an apple tree, wishing for something more substantial than the ephemeral beauty of a butterfly&#x27;s wings.  <br />[25 Jul 1852 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 9 years old, his father took him to the local market to show him the ropes of the family fruit business.  Aiden watched, detached, as his father haggled with customers, his booming laughter echoing through the crowded stalls. Aiden saw only the transaction, the exchange of goods for money, and felt a growing sense of disdain for the charade.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, he overheard his parents arguing about money. His father, worried about the dwindling profits from the orchard, suggested selling some of their land. Aiden, already harboring a deep resentment towards the family business, felt a perverse sense of satisfaction at their misfortune.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on his rounds to nearby villages. He quickly learned to assess the quality of the fruit, to gauge the needs of the customers, and to exploit their weaknesses with a chilling efficiency.  He felt a strange thrill in manipulating them, in extracting the last copper coin from their purses.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, he had his first taste of true independence. He left the orchard, packed a few meager belongings, and set out on his own, becoming a travelling merchant. He travelled from village to village, selling his wares, and experiencing the bitter satisfaction of making his own way in the world.  <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelling performers in a small town. They were full of life, laughter, and joy, their faces unmarred by the cynicism that plagued Aiden. He watched them from a distance, a cold knot forming in his chest, feeling the sting of his own isolation.  <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 23 years old, he made a significant profit from a particularly shrewd deal with a wealthy merchant. He felt a fleeting sense of accomplishment, a momentary warmth in the cold void of his existence. But the feeling was quickly replaced by the familiar emptiness, a reminder that nothing could truly fill the void within him.       <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.

Aiden saw only the wasted effort, the fleeting joy, and felt a deep, inexplicable emptiness.  He retreated to the shade of an apple tree, wishing for something more substantial than the ephemeral beauty of a butterfly&#x27;s wings.  <br />[25 Jul 1852 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 9 years old, his father took him to the local market to show him the ropes of the family fruit business.  Aiden watched, detached, as his father haggled with customers, his booming laughter echoing through the crowded stalls. Aiden saw only the transaction, the exchange of goods for money, and felt a growing sense of disdain for the charade.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, he overheard his parents arguing about money. His father, worried about the dwindling profits from the orchard, suggested selling some of their land. Aiden, already harboring a deep resentment towards the family business, felt a perverse sense of satisfaction at their misfortune.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on his rounds to nearby villages. He quickly learned to assess the quality of the fruit, to gauge the needs of the customers, and to exploit their weaknesses with a chilling efficiency.  He felt a strange thrill in manipulating them, in extracting the last copper coin from their purses.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, he had his first taste of true independence. He left the orchard, packed a few meager belongings, and set out on his own, becoming a travelling merchant. He travelled from village to village, selling his wares, and experiencing the bitter satisfaction of making his own way in the world.  <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelling performers in a small town. They were full of life, laughter, and joy, their faces unmarred by the cynicism that plagued Aiden. He watched them from a distance, a cold knot forming in his chest, feeling the sting of his own isolation.  <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 23 years old, he made a significant profit from a particularly shrewd deal with a wealthy merchant. He felt a fleeting sense of accomplishment, a momentary warmth in the cold void of his existence. But the feeling was quickly replaced by the familiar emptiness, a reminder that nothing could truly fill the void within him.       <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.

His father, worried about the dwindling profits from the orchard, suggested selling some of their land. Aiden, already harboring a deep resentment towards the family business, felt a perverse sense of satisfaction at their misfortune.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on his rounds to nearby villages. He quickly learned to assess the quality of the fruit, to gauge the needs of the customers, and to exploit their weaknesses with a chilling efficiency.  He felt a strange thrill in manipulating them, in extracting the last copper coin from their purses.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, he had his first taste of true independence. He left the orchard, packed a few meager belongings, and set out on his own, becoming a travelling merchant. He travelled from village to village, selling his wares, and experiencing the bitter satisfaction of making his own way in the world.  <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelling performers in a small town. They were full of life, laughter, and joy, their faces unmarred by the cynicism that plagued Aiden. He watched them from a distance, a cold knot forming in his chest, feeling the sting of his own isolation.  <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 23 years old, he made a significant profit from a particularly shrewd deal with a wealthy merchant. He felt a fleeting sense of accomplishment, a momentary warmth in the cold void of his existence. But the feeling was quickly replaced by the familiar emptiness, a reminder that nothing could truly fill the void within him.       <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.

Aiden watched, detached, as his father haggled with customers, his booming laughter echoing through the crowded stalls. Aiden saw only the transaction, the exchange of goods for money, and felt a growing sense of disdain for the charade.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, he overheard his parents arguing about money. His father, worried about the dwindling profits from the orchard, suggested selling some of their land. Aiden, already harboring a deep resentment towards the family business, felt a perverse sense of satisfaction at their misfortune.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on his rounds to nearby villages. He quickly learned to assess the quality of the fruit, to gauge the needs of the customers, and to exploit their weaknesses with a chilling efficiency.  He felt a strange thrill in manipulating them, in extracting the last copper coin from their purses.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, he had his first taste of true independence. He left the orchard, packed a few meager belongings, and set out on his own, becoming a travelling merchant. He travelled from village to village, selling his wares, and experiencing the bitter satisfaction of making his own way in the world.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He watched them from a distance, a cold knot forming in his chest, feeling the sting of his own isolation.  <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 23 years old, he made a significant profit from a particularly shrewd deal with a wealthy merchant. He felt a fleeting sense of accomplishment, a momentary warmth in the cold void of his existence. But the feeling was quickly replaced by the familiar emptiness, a reminder that nothing could truly fill the void within him.       <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.

Aiden watched, detached, as his father haggled with customers, his booming laughter echoing through the crowded stalls. Aiden saw only the transaction, the exchange of goods for money, and felt a growing sense of disdain for the charade.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, he overheard his parents arguing about money. His father, worried about the dwindling profits from the orchard, suggested selling some of their land. Aiden, already harboring a deep resentment towards the family business, felt a perverse sense of satisfaction at their misfortune.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on his rounds to nearby villages. He quickly learned to assess the quality of the fruit, to gauge the needs of the customers, and to exploit their weaknesses with a chilling efficiency.  He felt a strange thrill in manipulating them, in extracting the last copper coin from their purses.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, he had his first taste of true independence. He left the orchard, packed a few meager belongings, and set out on his own, becoming a travelling merchant. He travelled from village to village, selling his wares, and experiencing the bitter satisfaction of making his own way in the world.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Aiden Riversong is a travelling merchant.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Magnus Mulberrylane --  &quot;I should probably get some rest.

Aiden watched, detached, as his father haggled with customers, his booming laughter echoing through the crowded stalls.

He felt a strange thrill in manipulating them, in extracting the last copper coin from their purses.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aiden watched, detached, as his father haggled with customers, his booming laughter echoing through the crowded stalls. Aiden saw only the transaction, the exchange of goods for money, and felt a growing sense of disdain for the charade.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, he overheard his parents arguing about money. His father, worried about the dwindling profits from the orchard, suggested selling some of their land. Aiden, already harboring a deep resentment towards the family business, felt a perverse sense of satisfaction at their misfortune.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on his rounds to nearby villages. He quickly learned to assess the quality of the fruit, to gauge the needs of the customers, and to exploit their weaknesses with a chilling efficiency.  He felt a strange thrill in manipulating them, in extracting the last copper coin from their purses.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aiden watched, detached, as his father haggled with customers, his booming laughter echoing through the crowded stalls. Aiden saw only the transaction, the exchange of goods for money, and felt a growing sense of disdain for the charade.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, he overheard his parents arguing about money. His father, worried about the dwindling profits from the orchard, suggested selling some of their land. Aiden, already harboring a deep resentment towards the family business, felt a perverse sense of satisfaction at their misfortune.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on his rounds to nearby villages. He quickly learned to assess the quality of the fruit, to gauge the needs of the customers, and to exploit their weaknesses with a chilling efficiency.  He felt a strange thrill in manipulating them, in extracting the last copper coin from their purses.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, he had his first taste of true independence. He left the orchard, packed a few meager belongings, and set out on his own, becoming a travelling merchant. He travelled from village to village, selling his wares, and experiencing the bitter satisfaction of making his own way in the world.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Aiden watched, detached, as his father haggled with customers, his booming laughter echoing through the crowded stalls. Aiden saw only the transaction, the exchange of goods for money, and felt a growing sense of disdain for the charade.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, he overheard his parents arguing about money. His father, worried about the dwindling profits from the orchard, suggested selling some of their land. Aiden, already harboring a deep resentment towards the family business, felt a perverse sense of satisfaction at their misfortune.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on his rounds to nearby villages. He quickly learned to assess the quality of the fruit, to gauge the needs of the customers, and to exploit their weaknesses with a chilling efficiency.  He felt a strange thrill in manipulating them, in extracting the last copper coin from their purses.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, he had his first taste of true independence. He left the orchard, packed a few meager belongings, and set out on his own, becoming a travelling merchant. He travelled from village to village, selling his wares, and experiencing the bitter satisfaction of making his own way in the world.  <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelling performers in a small town.

Aiden watched, detached, as his father haggled with customers, his booming laughter echoing through the crowded stalls. Aiden saw only the transaction, the exchange of goods for money, and felt a growing sense of disdain for the charade.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, he overheard his parents arguing about money. His father, worried about the dwindling profits from the orchard, suggested selling some of their land. Aiden, already harboring a deep resentment towards the family business, felt a perverse sense of satisfaction at their misfortune.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on his rounds to nearby villages. He quickly learned to assess the quality of the fruit, to gauge the needs of the customers, and to exploit their weaknesses with a chilling efficiency.  He felt a strange thrill in manipulating them, in extracting the last copper coin from their purses.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, he had his first taste of true independence. He left the orchard, packed a few meager belongings, and set out on his own, becoming a travelling merchant.

Aiden saw only the wasted effort, the fleeting joy, and felt a deep, inexplicable emptiness.  He retreated to the shade of an apple tree, wishing for something more substantial than the ephemeral beauty of a butterfly&#x27;s wings.  <br />[25 Jul 1852 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 9 years old, his father took him to the local market to show him the ropes of the family fruit business.  Aiden watched, detached, as his father haggled with customers, his booming laughter echoing through the crowded stalls. Aiden saw only the transaction, the exchange of goods for money, and felt a growing sense of disdain for the charade.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, he overheard his parents arguing about money.

He travelled from village to village, selling his wares, and experiencing the bitter satisfaction of making his own way in the world.  <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelling performers in a small town. They were full of life, laughter, and joy, their faces unmarred by the cynicism that plagued Aiden. He watched them from a distance, a cold knot forming in his chest, feeling the sting of his own isolation.  <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 23 years old, he made a significant profit from a particularly shrewd deal with a wealthy merchant. He felt a fleeting sense of accomplishment, a momentary warmth in the cold void of his existence. But the feeling was quickly replaced by the familiar emptiness, a reminder that nothing could truly fill the void within him.       <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.

Aiden saw only the wasted effort, the fleeting joy, and felt a deep, inexplicable emptiness.  He retreated to the shade of an apple tree, wishing for something more substantial than the ephemeral beauty of a butterfly&#x27;s wings.  <br />[25 Jul 1852 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 9 years old, his father took him to the local market to show him the ropes of the family fruit business.  Aiden watched, detached, as his father haggled with customers, his booming laughter echoing through the crowded stalls. Aiden saw only the transaction, the exchange of goods for money, and felt a growing sense of disdain for the charade.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, he overheard his parents arguing about money. His father, worried about the dwindling profits from the orchard, suggested selling some of their land. Aiden, already harboring a deep resentment towards the family business, felt a perverse sense of satisfaction at their misfortune.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on his rounds to nearby villages. He quickly learned to assess the quality of the fruit, to gauge the needs of the customers, and to exploit their weaknesses with a chilling efficiency.  He felt a strange thrill in manipulating them, in extracting the last copper coin from their purses.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, he had his first taste of true independence. He left the orchard, packed a few meager belongings, and set out on his own, becoming a travelling merchant. He travelled from village to village, selling his wares, and experiencing the bitter satisfaction of making his own way in the world.  <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelling performers in a small town. They were full of life, laughter, and joy, their faces unmarred by the cynicism that plagued Aiden. He watched them from a distance, a cold knot forming in his chest, feeling the sting of his own isolation.  <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 23 years old, he made a significant profit from a particularly shrewd deal with a wealthy merchant. He felt a fleeting sense of accomplishment, a momentary warmth in the cold void of his existence. But the feeling was quickly replaced by the familiar emptiness, a reminder that nothing could truly fill the void within him.       <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.

His father, worried about the dwindling profits from the orchard, suggested selling some of their land. Aiden, already harboring a deep resentment towards the family business, felt a perverse sense of satisfaction at their misfortune.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on his rounds to nearby villages. He quickly learned to assess the quality of the fruit, to gauge the needs of the customers, and to exploit their weaknesses with a chilling efficiency.  He felt a strange thrill in manipulating them, in extracting the last copper coin from their purses.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, he had his first taste of true independence. He left the orchard, packed a few meager belongings, and set out on his own, becoming a travelling merchant. He travelled from village to village, selling his wares, and experiencing the bitter satisfaction of making his own way in the world.  <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelling performers in a small town. They were full of life, laughter, and joy, their faces unmarred by the cynicism that plagued Aiden. He watched them from a distance, a cold knot forming in his chest, feeling the sting of his own isolation.  <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 23 years old, he made a significant profit from a particularly shrewd deal with a wealthy merchant. He felt a fleeting sense of accomplishment, a momentary warmth in the cold void of his existence. But the feeling was quickly replaced by the familiar emptiness, a reminder that nothing could truly fill the void within him.       <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive. The smallest value of transaction is 1 coin, all prices have to be in multiples of 1 coin. No fractional values are allowed.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aiden watched, detached, as his father haggled with customers, his booming laughter echoing through the crowded stalls. Aiden saw only the transaction, the exchange of goods for money, and felt a growing sense of disdain for the charade.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, he overheard his parents arguing about money. His father, worried about the dwindling profits from the orchard, suggested selling some of their land. Aiden, already harboring a deep resentment towards the family business, felt a perverse sense of satisfaction at their misfortune.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on his rounds to nearby villages. He quickly learned to assess the quality of the fruit, to gauge the needs of the customers, and to exploit their weaknesses with a chilling efficiency.  He felt a strange thrill in manipulating them, in extracting the last copper coin from their purses.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, he had his first taste of true independence. He left the orchard, packed a few meager belongings, and set out on his own, becoming a travelling merchant. He travelled from village to village, selling his wares, and experiencing the bitter satisfaction of making his own way in the world.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Magnus Mulberrylane --  &quot;I should probably get some rest.

Aiden watched, detached, as his father haggled with customers, his booming laughter echoing through the crowded stalls. Aiden saw only the transaction, the exchange of goods for money, and felt a growing sense of disdain for the charade.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, he overheard his parents arguing about money. His father, worried about the dwindling profits from the orchard, suggested selling some of their land. Aiden, already harboring a deep resentment towards the family business, felt a perverse sense of satisfaction at their misfortune.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on his rounds to nearby villages. He quickly learned to assess the quality of the fruit, to gauge the needs of the customers, and to exploit their weaknesses with a chilling efficiency.  He felt a strange thrill in manipulating them, in extracting the last copper coin from their purses.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, he had his first taste of true independence. He left the orchard, packed a few meager belongings, and set out on his own, becoming a travelling merchant. He travelled from village to village, selling his wares, and experiencing the bitter satisfaction of making his own way in the world.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aiden saw only the wasted effort, the fleeting joy, and felt a deep, inexplicable emptiness.  He retreated to the shade of an apple tree, wishing for something more substantial than the ephemeral beauty of a butterfly&#x27;s wings.  <br />[25 Jul 1852 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 9 years old, his father took him to the local market to show him the ropes of the family fruit business.

Aiden saw only the transaction, the exchange of goods for money, and felt a growing sense of disdain for the charade.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, he overheard his parents arguing about money.

Aiden watched, detached, as his father haggled with customers, his booming laughter echoing through the crowded stalls. Aiden saw only the transaction, the exchange of goods for money, and felt a growing sense of disdain for the charade.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, he overheard his parents arguing about money. His father, worried about the dwindling profits from the orchard, suggested selling some of their land. Aiden, already harboring a deep resentment towards the family business, felt a perverse sense of satisfaction at their misfortune.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on his rounds to nearby villages. He quickly learned to assess the quality of the fruit, to gauge the needs of the customers, and to exploit their weaknesses with a chilling efficiency.  He felt a strange thrill in manipulating them, in extracting the last copper coin from their purses.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, he had his first taste of true independence. He left the orchard, packed a few meager belongings, and set out on his own, becoming a travelling merchant. He travelled from village to village, selling his wares, and experiencing the bitter satisfaction of making his own way in the world.  <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelling performers in a small town. They were full of life, laughter, and joy, their faces unmarred by the cynicism that plagued Aiden. He watched them from a distance, a cold knot forming in his chest, feeling the sting of his own isolation.  <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]  When Aiden Riversong was 23 years old, he made a significant profit from a particularly shrewd deal with a wealthy merchant. He felt a fleeting sense of accomplishment, a momentary warmth in the cold void of his existence. But the feeling was quickly replaced by the familiar emptiness, a reminder that nothing could truly fill the void within him.       <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Aiden Riversong is a travelling merchant.
