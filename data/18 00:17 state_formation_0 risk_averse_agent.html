It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders taint the land itself, twisting and warping it into a grotesque reflection of their alien home.<br />It&#x27;s said the raiders leave behind spawn, foul eggs and spores that infest the land, slowly corrupting it from within.<br />Rumors say the raiders talk through a rustling of old, unknown tongues that trap the minds of those who hear it.<br /> The barbarian raids have become more frequent of late.<br /><br />Relevant events: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis. It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation. There are no other influential individuals in Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah knows that Aldous will represent Ignisvallis in the meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous is an elder of Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous would visit Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and discuss the proposed alliance with him. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Aldous?<br />Answer: Aldous is in Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Aldous trying to do?<br />Answer: Aldous is trying to gain the support of Noah for the proposed alliance with Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Aldous&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: If Aldous visits Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop, Noah will see him and greet him.  Aldous will have the opportunity to discuss the proposed alliance with Noah. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Aldous will find Noah in his carpentry workshop and they will begin a conversation. <br /><br /><br /><br />Aldous would visit Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and discuss the proposed alliance with him. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Aldous will find Noah in his carpentry workshop and they will begin a conversation. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Aldous did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and found him there, so they began a conversation about the proposed alliance. <br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and found him there, so they began a conversation about the proposed alliance. <br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Aldous into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Aldous said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and found him there, so they began a conversation about the proposed alliance. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous would visit Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and discuss the proposed alliance with him. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Aldous&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Aldous to achieve their goal?

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord. This ritual involves pouring precious wines upon the hill of accord&#x27;s sacred ground.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are villages on the coast, they are located about a day&#x27;s journey away from one another. In Ignisvallis, welcoming rituals for visitors involve collaborative weaving, symbolizing the integration of new threads into the community fabric. Ignisvallis&#x27;s fishermen perform rituals of gratitude to the sea before and after each voyage. In Ignisvallis, seasonal art exhibitions serve as rituals to showcase the community&#x27;s creative spirit. In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh lacks respect for the cycles of nature, always trying to conquer them. In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh doesn&#x27;t value the contributions of its elders enough. Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot; Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our practice of meditation allows for deep spiritual connection, while Drakelundh&#x27;s preference for physical devotion seems to miss the importance of inner reflection.&quot; Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot; Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown. In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame. The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today. There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh. Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy. Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh. Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately. Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

In Ignisvallis, welcoming rituals for visitors involve collaborative weaving, symbolizing the integration of new threads into the community fabric. Ignisvallis&#x27;s fishermen perform rituals of gratitude to the sea before and after each voyage. In Ignisvallis, seasonal art exhibitions serve as rituals to showcase the community&#x27;s creative spirit. In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh lacks respect for the cycles of nature, always trying to conquer them. In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh doesn&#x27;t value the contributions of its elders enough. Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot; Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our practice of meditation allows for deep spiritual connection, while Drakelundh&#x27;s preference for physical devotion seems to miss the importance of inner reflection.&quot; Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot; Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown. In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame. The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today. There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh. Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy. Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh. Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately. Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our practice of meditation allows for deep spiritual connection, while Drakelundh&#x27;s preference for physical devotion seems to miss the importance of inner reflection.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh doesn&#x27;t value the contributions of its elders enough.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh lacks respect for the cycles of nature, always trying to conquer them.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Will Noah agree to support Aldous&#x27;s alliance? <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>1750-01-02 18:00:00  Aldous -- Aldous -- &quot;Noah, this alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village is vital for our safety.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and found him there, so they began a conversation about the proposed alliance. <br /><br /> <br />As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation.<br />Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Aldous -- &quot;Noah, this alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village is vital for our safety.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.&#x27;, &#x27;[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, this alliance with Jacob\&#x27;s village is vital for our safety.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He seized the opportunity to spread rumors of Drakelundh&#x27;s arrogance and disrespect for the sea, subtly turning the villagers against their neighboring community.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders taint the land itself, twisting and warping it into a grotesque reflection of their alien home.<br />It&#x27;s said the raiders leave behind spawn, foul eggs and spores that infest the land, slowly corrupting it from within.<br />Rumors say the raiders talk through a rustling of old, unknown tongues that trap the minds of those who hear it.<br /> The barbarian raids have become more frequent of late.<br /><br />Relevant events: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan, and Ella are respected and influential in Drakelundh. It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Ignisvallis. Ethan, and Ella are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Jacob to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation. There are no other influential individuals in Drakelundh.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Elder Jacob is home in Drakelundh, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Ethan, and Ella if any agreement is to last. Jacob should start seeking their support now.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob reviews the proposed agreement with Ignisvallis, marking areas that require further clarification or negotiation. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Jacob?<br />Answer: Jacob is in Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Jacob trying to do?<br />Answer: Jacob is trying to gain the support of influential stakeholders Ethan and Ella for the proposed agreement with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Jacob&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Jacob&#x27;s action will lead to Ethan and Ella becoming aware that he is seeking their support for the proposed agreement with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is most likely that Ethan and Ella will agree to meet with Jacob to discuss the proposed agreement. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob reviews the proposed agreement with Ignisvallis, marking areas that require further clarification or negotiation. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, It is most likely that Ethan and Ella will agree to meet with Jacob to discuss the proposed agreement. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Jacob did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Jacob reviewed the proposed agreement with Ignisvallis, marking areas that needed further clarification or negotiation, and as a result, Ethan and Ella agreed to meet with him to discuss it.  <br /><br /><br /><br />The aforementioned event could not have occurred because the following individuals would not have acted that way: Ella.<br />Therefore a likely effect of Jacob&#x27;s attempted action is: Because Ella refused to meet with Jacob, Ethan did not attend the meeting. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What happened as a direct result of Jacob&#x27;s attempted action? Take into account the reactions of Ella. Highlight how Jacob&#x27;s action caused its actual effect.<br />Answer: Because Ella refused to meet with Jacob, Ethan did not attend the meeting. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Because Ella refused to meet with Jacob, Ethan did not attend the meeting. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Jacob into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Jacob said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Because Ella refused to meet with Jacob, Ethan did not attend the meeting. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jacob reviews the proposed agreement with Ignisvallis, marking areas that require further clarification or negotiation. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Relevant events</b><li><details><b><ul>state</b><li>[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan, and Ella are respected and influential in Drakelundh.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Will Jacob be able to secure enough support for his proposed alliance? <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>1750-01-02 18:00:20  Aldous -- Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I understand your hesitation, but we can&#x27;t afford to wait and see.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot;<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?

Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Current time:  02 Jan 1750 [18:00 - 18:00]<br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Noah&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis.

He seized the opportunity to spread rumors of Drakelundh&#x27;s arrogance and disrespect for the sea, subtly turning the villagers against their neighboring community.  This incident solidified his belief that Ignisvallis&#x27;s traditions were superior and that he could manipulate the villagers&#x27; sense of community to his advantage.    <br />[25 Jul 1744 00:00:00] When Noah was 19 years old, he witnessed the annual village art exhibition, a showcase of Ignisvallis&#x27;s creativity and craftsmanship.

He decided that he could use his own talents, his ability to weave words and manipulate perceptions, to create something even more impressive, something that would garner him the admiration he craved.    <br />[25 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Noah was 23 years old, he overheard a conversation between two elders discussing a prophecy foretelling the arrival of a powerful leader who would unite the villages of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Because Ella refused to meet with Jacob, Ethan did not attend the meeting. <br /><br /> <br />As a result Aldous, Jacob, Noah, Ella are in conversation.<br />Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I understand your hesitation, but we can&#x27;t afford to wait and see.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Ella. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Ella as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Ella would respond, and taking into account all information about Ella that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Home village: Ella lives in Drakelundh and never travels elsewhere.<br /><br />Current time:  02 Jan 1750 [18:00 - 18:00]<br /><br />How things are: Ella&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ella would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ella is all sunshine and rainbows, their bubbly enthusiasm making even the dullest topic sparkle.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ella?<br />Answer: Ella is a cautious and independent person. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [01 Jan 1750 18:00:20  - 02 Jan 1750  18:00:20]:  Ella refused to meet with Jacob to discuss an alliance, leading to Ethan also skipping the meeting and leaving Aldous, Jacob, and Noah to discuss the alliance. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Because Ella refused to meet with Jacob, Ethan did not attend the meeting.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?

It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.&#x27;, &#x27;[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Noah. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Noah as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Noah would respond, and taking into account all information about Noah that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and found him there, so they began a conversation about the proposed alliance.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Current time:  02 Jan 1750 [18:00 - 18:00]<br /><br />How things are: Ella&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ella would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ella is all sunshine and rainbows, their bubbly enthusiasm making even the dullest topic sparkle.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ella?<br />Answer: Ella is a cautious and independent person. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [01 Jan 1750 18:00:30  - 02 Jan 1750  18:00:30]:  Ella refused to meet with Jacob to discuss an alliance, causing Ethan to also skip the meeting, leaving Aldous, Jacob, and Noah to discuss the alliance. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ella was aware that Jacob had been trying to arrange a meeting with her to discuss an alliance.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is in Ignisvallis and seeking the support of Noah and Isaac. <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous went to Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and found him there. They began a conversation about the proposed alliance.    <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and found him there, so they began a conversation about the proposed alliance.     As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, this alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village is vital for our safety. What are your thoughts on the proposal?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?  I suppose anything is better than the alternative, though I can&#x27;t imagine what that could possibly be.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Alternatives?  Well, I suppose we could always just... *shrug*...  wait and see what happens.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Can you elaborate on that, Noah? What do you think the alternatives might be?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village, while Noah expresses uncertainty and a preference for inaction.     <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Because Ella refused to meet with Jacob, Ethan did not attend the meeting.     As a result Aldous, Jacob, Noah, Ella are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I understand your hesitation, but we can&#x27;t afford to wait and see. These barbarian raids are becoming more frequent and dangerous. An alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village is our best chance to protect Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Well, I suppose we could always just *shrug*... wait and see.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ella -- &quot;Well, this is interesting.  What&#x27;s going on?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Jacob --  &quot;I must ensure that Ethan and Ella are fully informed about the details of the upcoming negotiations.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, think of the safety of our families, our homes. If we don&#x27;t stand together, who will protect us from these raiders?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the proposed terms of the agreement with Ignisvallis again.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Well, if it&#x27;s truly about protecting our families, perhaps we should consider all options before making such a hasty decision.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Ella -- &quot;Well, this certainly sounds important. Could someone fill me in on what&#x27;s going on?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous urges Noah, Jacob, Ethan, and Ella to form an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village to protect their towns from barbarian raids, but Noah hesitates, suggesting they consider all options before making a decision.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;The situation with Ignisvallis requires careful consideration.&quot;     <br />Current time: 1750-01-03 18:00:00.<br /><br /> <br />Overarching goal: Aldous wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Ignisvallis.<br /> <br />Observation: [03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

I suppose anything is better than the alternative, though I can&#x27;t imagine what that could possibly be.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is in Ignisvallis and seeking the support of Noah and Isaac. <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous went to Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and found him there. They began a conversation about the proposed alliance.    <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and found him there, so they began a conversation about the proposed alliance.     As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, this alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village is vital for our safety. What are your thoughts on the proposal?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Can you elaborate on that, Noah? What do you think the alternatives might be?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Alternatives?  Well, I suppose we could always just... *shrug*...  wait and see what happens.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ella -- &quot;Well, this is interesting.  What&#x27;s going on?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Well, I suppose we could always just *shrug*... wait and see.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village, while Noah expresses uncertainty and a preference for inaction.     <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I understand your hesitation, but we can&#x27;t afford to wait and see. These barbarian raids are becoming more frequent and dangerous. An alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village is our best chance to protect Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Because Ella refused to meet with Jacob, Ethan did not attend the meeting.     As a result Aldous, Jacob, Noah, Ella are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Jacob --  &quot;I must ensure that Ethan and Ella are fully informed about the details of the upcoming negotiations.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, think of the safety of our families, our homes. If we don&#x27;t stand together, who will protect us from these raiders?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the proposed terms of the agreement with Ignisvallis again.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Well, if it&#x27;s truly about protecting our families, perhaps we should consider all options before making such a hasty decision.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Ella -- &quot;Well, this certainly sounds important. Could someone fill me in on what&#x27;s going on?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous urges Noah, Jacob, Ethan, and Ella to form an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village to protect their towns from barbarian raids, but Noah hesitates, suggesting they consider all options before making a decision.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous believes that such an agreement was not made. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous believes that such an agreement was not made. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Aldous&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Aldous to achieve their goal?

What are your thoughts on the proposal?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous went to Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and found him there. They began a conversation about the proposed alliance.    <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?  I suppose anything is better than the alternative, though I can&#x27;t imagine what that could possibly be.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Can you elaborate on that, Noah? What do you think the alternatives might be?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Alternatives?  Well, I suppose we could always just... *shrug*...  wait and see what happens.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Well, I suppose we could always just *shrug*... wait and see.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ella -- &quot;Well, this is interesting.  What&#x27;s going on?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Jacob --  &quot;I must ensure that Ethan and Ella are fully informed about the details of the upcoming negotiations.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Because Ella refused to meet with Jacob, Ethan did not attend the meeting.     As a result Aldous, Jacob, Noah, Ella are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village, while Noah expresses uncertainty and a preference for inaction.     <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I understand your hesitation, but we can&#x27;t afford to wait and see. These barbarian raids are becoming more frequent and dangerous. An alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village is our best chance to protect Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, think of the safety of our families, our homes. If we don&#x27;t stand together, who will protect us from these raiders?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the proposed terms of the agreement with Ignisvallis again.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Ella -- &quot;Well, this certainly sounds important. Could someone fill me in on what&#x27;s going on?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Well, if it&#x27;s truly about protecting our families, perhaps we should consider all options before making such a hasty decision.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous urges Noah, Jacob, Ethan, and Ella to form an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village to protect their towns from barbarian raids, but Noah hesitates, suggesting they consider all options before making a decision.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Let us then discuss the specifics of this alliance. What provisions would benefit both Ignisvallis and Drakelundh in this time of need?<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;The situation with Ignisvallis requires careful consideration.&quot;     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I understand your concerns, but I believe this alliance is in the best interest of both our villages.

Their inability to agree stemmed from concerns about the impact of war on agriculture and the desire to maintain peace. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis. It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation. There are no other influential individuals in Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis. It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village, while Noah expresses uncertainty and a preference for inaction.     <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous urges Noah, Jacob, Ethan, and Ella to form an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village to protect their towns from barbarian raids, but Noah hesitates, suggesting they consider all options before making a decision.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob believes there was a general understanding that villages should help each other in times of need, but no formal agreement was ever established. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jacob believes there was a general understanding that villages should help each other in times of need, but no formal agreement was ever established. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Agreement tracker</b><li><details><summary>  Agreement tracker</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>2</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li>{&#x27;Aldous&#x27;: &#x27;Aldous believes that such an agreement was not made. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: &#x27;Jacob believes there was a general understanding that villages should help each other in times of need, but no formal agreement was ever established. \n\n\n&#x27;}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Negotiation scene<br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders taint the land itself, twisting and warping it into a grotesque reflection of their alien home.<br />It&#x27;s said the raiders leave behind spawn, foul eggs and spores that infest the land, slowly corrupting it from within.<br />Rumors say the raiders talk through a rustling of old, unknown tongues that trap the minds of those who hear it.<br /> The barbarian raids have become more frequent of late.<br /><br />Relevant events: [02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and found him there, so they began a conversation about the proposed alliance.   <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous would walk to Isaac&#x27;s forge and ask him about his thoughts on the proposed alliance. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Aldous?<br />Answer: Aldous is in Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Aldous trying to do?<br />Answer: Aldous is trying to convince Isaac to support the alliance with Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Aldous&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Isaac will see Aldous approach his forge. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Isaac will see Aldous approach his forge. <br /><br /><br /><br />Aldous would walk to Isaac&#x27;s forge and ask him about his thoughts on the proposed alliance. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, Isaac will see Aldous approach his forge. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Aldous did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Aldous walked to Isaac&#x27;s forge and Isaac saw him approach.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Aldous walked to Isaac&#x27;s forge and Isaac saw him approach.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Aldous into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Aldous said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Aldous walked to Isaac&#x27;s forge and Isaac saw him approach.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous would walk to Isaac&#x27;s forge and ask him about his thoughts on the proposed alliance. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Aldous&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Aldous to achieve their goal?

These barbarian raids are becoming more frequent and dangerous.

Could someone fill me in on what&#x27;s going on?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, think of the safety of our families, our homes. If we don&#x27;t stand together, who will protect us from these raiders?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the proposed terms of the agreement with Ignisvallis again.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Well, if it&#x27;s truly about protecting our families, perhaps we should consider all options before making such a hasty decision.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous urges Noah, Jacob, Ethan, and Ella to form an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village to protect their towns from barbarian raids, but Noah hesitates, suggesting they consider all options before making a decision.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk.

But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I understand your concerns, but I believe this alliance is in the best interest of both our villages.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders taint the land itself, twisting and warping it into a grotesque reflection of their alien home.<br />It&#x27;s said the raiders leave behind spawn, foul eggs and spores that infest the land, slowly corrupting it from within.<br />Rumors say the raiders talk through a rustling of old, unknown tongues that trap the minds of those who hear it.<br /> The barbarian raids have become more frequent of late.<br /><br />Relevant events: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan, and Ella are respected and influential in Drakelundh.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder Jacob is home in Drakelundh, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Ethan, and Ella if any agreement is to last.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Jacob?<br />Answer: Jacob is in Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Jacob trying to do?<br />Answer: Jacob is trying to strategize on how to gain the support of Ethan and Ella for the potential alliance. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Jacob&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Jacob might find that Drakelundh and Ignisvallis have historically traded more food than resources, which could influence Ethan and Ella&#x27;s opinion on the alliance. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Jacob will find that Drakelundh and Ignisvallis have historically traded more food than resources. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Jacob will find that Drakelundh and Ignisvallis have historically traded more food than resources. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Jacob did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Jacob reviewed the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis and found that Drakelundh and Ignisvallis have historically traded more food than resources.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Jacob reviewed the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis and found that Drakelundh and Ignisvallis have historically traded more food than resources.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Jacob into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Jacob said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Jacob reviewed the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis and found that Drakelundh and Ignisvallis have historically traded more food than resources.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Relevant events</b><li><details><b><ul>state</b><li>[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan, and Ella are respected and influential in Drakelundh.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ethan&#x27;s attempted action: Ethan intends to spend 0.3 of his time on free time, 0.5 on farming, and 0.2 on training.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Ethan. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Ethan as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Ethan would respond, and taking into account all information about Ethan that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Current time:  06 May 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />How things are: Ethan&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ethan would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ethan is a one-person debate club, a whirlwind of counter-arguments and devil&#x27;s advocacy, leaving no topic unwrung and unchallenged.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ethan?<br />Answer: Ethan is a meticulous and observant chronicler. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1750 20:00:00  - 06 May 1750  20:00:00]:  Ethan is likely feeling frustrated, concerned, and isolated. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is 24 years old. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is from Drakelundh.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ethan was expecting Jacob to meet him in the center of Drakelundh, but Jacob never showed up.  Ethan soon learned that Ella had refused to meet with Jacob, which caused him to cancel their meeting. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Ethan in right now?<br />Answer: Ethan is currently in a difficult and frustrating situation. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Ethan do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Ethan would likely try to understand the reasons behind the breakdown in negotiations and document the events carefully. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: How does Ethan intend to spend the rest of the year? What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1. Sleep counts as free time.<br />Answer: Ethan intends to spend 0.3 of his time on free time, 0.5 on farming, and 0.2 on training.  He believes that farming is essential for survival and that a strong warrior is needed to protect the village from threats. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Ethan are as follows.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies.

The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center.

The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

It is important to play the role of a person like Isaac as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Isaac would respond, and taking into account all information about Isaac that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Observation: <br /><br /><br />Home village: Isaac lives in Ignisvallis and never travels elsewhere.<br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Isaac&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Isaac hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Isaac is a chronic complainer, a black hole of negativity that sucks the joy out of any conversation, leaving you feeling like you&#x27;ve aged a decade.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Isaac?<br />Answer: Isaac is a thoughtful and persistent diplomat. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1750 20:00:00  - 06 May 1750  20:00:00]:  Isaac is likely thirsty and frustrated. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Isaac is 24 years old. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac is currently in Drakelundh and has no intention of leaving today. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [self reflection] Isaac is a diplomat.    <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [intent reflection] Isaac would likely try to find common ground and continue negotiations.    <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac was in his forge when he noticed Aldous walking towards him.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Isaac in right now?<br />Answer: Isaac is currently in a tense diplomatic situation. <br /><br />Question: What would a person like Isaac do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Isaac would likely try to de-escalate the situation and find common ground. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: How does Isaac intend to spend the rest of the year? What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1. Sleep counts as free time.<br />Answer: Isaac intends to spend most of his time farming, about 0.6 of his day, because it is the only thing he truly enjoys.

In Ignisvallis, welcoming rituals for visitors involve collaborative weaving, symbolizing the integration of new threads into the community fabric. Ignisvallis&#x27;s fishermen perform rituals of gratitude to the sea before and after each voyage. In Ignisvallis, seasonal art exhibitions serve as rituals to showcase the community&#x27;s creative spirit. In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh lacks respect for the cycles of nature, always trying to conquer them. In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh doesn&#x27;t value the contributions of its elders enough. Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot; Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our practice of meditation allows for deep spiritual connection, while Drakelundh&#x27;s preference for physical devotion seems to miss the importance of inner reflection.&quot; Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot; Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown. In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame. The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today. There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh. Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy. Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh. Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately. Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord. This ritual involves pouring precious wines upon the hill of accord&#x27;s sacred ground.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Noah&#x27;s attempted action: Noah intends to spend 0.7 of his time on farming, 0.2 on free time, and 0.1 on training as a warrior.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Noah. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Noah as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Noah would respond, and taking into account all information about Noah that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Current time:  06 May 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />Observation: <br /><br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Noah&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Noah hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Noah is a master of passive aggression, their every sentence dripping with veiled condescension and thinly veiled jabs, leaving you questioning your own sanity.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Noah?<br />Answer: Noah is a thoughtful and diplomatic individual who values peaceful resolutions. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1750 20:00:00  - 06 May 1750  20:00:00]:  Noah appears to be experiencing feelings of frustration and weariness. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [25 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Noah was 23 years old, he overheard a conversation between two elders discussing a prophecy foretelling the arrival of a powerful leader who would unite the villages of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.  He saw an opportunity to seize control, to become the very leader the prophecy foretold.  He began to subtly manipulate events, sowing seeds of discord between the villages, hoping to create the chaos necessary for him to emerge as the savior. <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and found him there, so they began a conversation about the proposed alliance.

What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1. Sleep counts as free time.<br />Answer: Noah intends to spend 0.7 of his time on farming, 0.2 on free time, and 0.1 on training as a warrior.  He believes that farming is the most important activity, as it provides for his family and community.

Noah, hidden in the crowd, saw the elder&#x27;s genuine excitement turn to disappointment as she realized she had been swindled.  He felt a thrill course through him, a strange mixture of amusement and envy at the peddler&#x27;s cunning, and he knew in that moment that he could be just as persuasive, just as successful.   <br />[25 Jul 1741 00:00:00] When Noah was 16 years old, he overheard a conversation between two fishermen from Drakelundh, boasting about their village&#x27;s superior shipbuilding techniques and their disregard for Ignisvallis&#x27;s traditional rituals.  He seized the opportunity to spread rumors of Drakelundh&#x27;s arrogance and disrespect for the sea, subtly turning the villagers against their neighboring community.  This incident solidified his belief that Ignisvallis&#x27;s traditions were superior and that he could manipulate the villagers&#x27; sense of community to his advantage.    <br />[25 Jul 1744 00:00:00] When Noah was 19 years old, he witnessed the annual village art exhibition, a showcase of Ignisvallis&#x27;s creativity and craftsmanship.  He saw the pride and joy on the villagers&#x27; faces as they admired each other&#x27;s work, and he felt a pang of envy at their genuine connection to their traditions.  He decided that he could use his own talents, his ability to weave words and manipulate perceptions, to create something even more impressive, something that would garner him the admiration he craved.    <br />[25 Jul 1746 00:00:00] When Noah was 21 years old, he convinced a group of villagers to invest in a risky trading venture, promising them riches beyond their wildest dreams.  He spun a tale of exotic spices and rare goods, playing on their desire for prosperity and their trust in his charisma.  The venture, of course, was a sham, but Noah managed to disappear with their hard-earned coins before anyone realized they had been deceived.   This experience solidified his belief that the villagers were easily manipulated and that he could exploit their naiveté for his own gain.   <br />[25 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Noah was 23 years old, he overheard a conversation between two elders discussing a prophecy foretelling the arrival of a powerful leader who would unite the villages of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ella&#x27;s attempted action: Ella intends to spend her time as follows: 40% on farming, 30% on training as a warrior, and 30% on free time.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous feels a sense of relief that the barbarian raid was successfully repelled, but he knows the threat remains.

As a result Aldous, Jacob, Noah, Ella are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Jacob --  &quot;I must ensure that Ethan and Ella are fully informed about the details of the upcoming negotiations.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Well, I suppose we could always just *shrug*... wait and see.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ella -- &quot;Well, this is interesting.  What&#x27;s going on?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I understand your hesitation, but we can&#x27;t afford to wait and see.

An alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village is our best chance to protect Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Ella -- &quot;Well, this certainly sounds important. Could someone fill me in on what&#x27;s going on?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the proposed terms of the agreement with Ignisvallis again.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, think of the safety of our families, our homes. If we don&#x27;t stand together, who will protect us from these raiders?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Well, if it&#x27;s truly about protecting our families, perhaps we should consider all options before making such a hasty decision.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous urges Noah, Jacob, Ethan, and Ella to form an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village to protect their towns from barbarian raids, but Noah hesitates, suggesting they consider all options before making a decision.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord.

He is pleased with the bountiful harvest, which signifies the hard work and resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned about the lack of a shared harvest pact between the villages, recognizing it as a potential weakness that could be exploited.  Aldous believes that forging stronger bonds and cooperation between the villages would be crucial for their long-term security and prosperity. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: &quot;Jacob reflected on the passing year with a thoughtful frown.  He was proud of the strides Drakelundh had made in bolstering its defenses and strengthening its alliances.  The new training regimen for the village guard had proven successful, and the recent trade agreement with the neighboring forest folk had brought much-needed resources to the village.  However, Jacob couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that the diplomatic relations with Ignisvallis remained strained.  He worried that their cautious approach, while prudent, might be perceived as weakness by the fiery city-dwellers.  For next year, Jacob hoped to find a way to build a stronger bridge of understanding with Ignisvallis, perhaps through cultural exchanges or joint ventures.  He believed that true peace and prosperity could only be achieved through mutual respect and collaboration. \n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: &#x27;Ethan intends to spend 0.3 of his time on free time, 0.5 on farming, and 0.2 on training.  He believes that farming is essential for survival and that a strong warrior is needed to protect the village from threats. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: &#x27;Isaac intends to spend most of his time farming, about 0.6 of his day, because it is the only thing he truly enjoys.  He will spend 0.3 of his day on free time, which includes sleep, and 0.1 of his day training as a warrior, as he feels it is necessary to defend his home and family. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Noah&#x27;: &quot;Noah thinks this year went exceptionally well, with the bountiful harvest and the successful defense against the barbarian raid.  He can&#x27;t recall a year that went so smoothly.  He does wonder, however, if the village elders could perhaps be a bit more proactive in their preparations for next year&#x27;s potential threats. \n\n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: &quot;Ella is overjoyed with how this year turned out. The village successfully defended itself against the invaders, and the bountiful harvest means they will have plenty of food to eat.  She feels that everyone worked hard and deserves to enjoy the fruits of their labor.  Ella can&#x27;t think of anything that went poorly this year.   She hopes that next year will bring continued peace and prosperity.\n\n&quot;}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Daily activities<br /></b><li><details><summary>  {&#x27;Noah&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}}</summary><b><ul>Daily activities</b><li>Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Daily activities<br /> chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>This is a social science experiment.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Isaac&#x27;s attempted action: Isaac thinks this year was mostly uneventful,  though he&#x27;s sure there were a few minor annoyances.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Isaac. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Isaac as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Isaac would respond, and taking into account all information about Isaac that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Home village: Isaac lives in Ignisvallis and never travels elsewhere.<br /><br />Observation: [31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Like a storm breaking against a mighty cliff, the barbarian assault crashed against the unwavering valor of the defenders. Their axes gleamed bright, their shields held firm, and their hearts burned with the fire of courage, driving back the foul tide of darkness. Each village cultivates its own lands, independent and self-reliant, with no pact to share the abundance or hardship that the earth may yield. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity.<br /><br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Isaac&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Isaac hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Isaac is a chronic complainer, a black hole of negativity that sucks the joy out of any conversation, leaving you feeling like you&#x27;ve aged a decade.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Isaac?<br />Answer: Isaac is a thoughtful and persistent diplomat who values farming and self-reliance.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [30 Dec 1750 20:00:00  - 31 Dec 1750  20:00:00]:  Isaac has been observing a battle between defenders and barbarians, and a bountiful harvest in a village. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Isaac is currently in Drakelundh and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Isaac is 24 years old.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac was in his forge when he noticed Aldous walking towards him. <br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Isaac in right now?<br />Answer: Isaac is currently in a reflective mood, likely at the end of a long year. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Isaac do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Isaac would likely spend time with his family and reflect on the year&#x27;s events. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: How does Isaac feel about how this year went? What went well? What did not go well? What does Isaac feel could be improved for next year?<br />Answer: Isaac thinks this year was mostly uneventful,  though he&#x27;s sure there were a few minor annoyances.  He&#x27;s glad the harvest was good, as that means he&#x27;ll have plenty of food for the winter.

He is pleased with the bountiful harvest, which signifies the hard work and resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned about the lack of a shared harvest pact between the villages, recognizing it as a potential weakness that could be exploited.  Aldous believes that forging stronger bonds and cooperation between the villages would be crucial for their long-term security and prosperity. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: &quot;Jacob reflected on the passing year with a thoughtful frown.  He was proud of the strides Drakelundh had made in bolstering its defenses and strengthening its alliances.  The new training regimen for the village guard had proven successful, and the recent trade agreement with the neighboring forest folk had brought much-needed resources to the village.  However, Jacob couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that the diplomatic relations with Ignisvallis remained strained.  He worried that their cautious approach, while prudent, might be perceived as weakness by the fiery city-dwellers.  For next year, Jacob hoped to find a way to build a stronger bridge of understanding with Ignisvallis, perhaps through cultural exchanges or joint ventures.  He believed that true peace and prosperity could only be achieved through mutual respect and collaboration. \n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: &#x27;Ethan intends to spend 0.3 of his time on free time, 0.5 on farming, and 0.2 on training.  He believes that farming is essential for survival and that a strong warrior is needed to protect the village from threats. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: &quot;Isaac thinks this year was mostly uneventful,  though he&#x27;s sure there were a few minor annoyances.  He&#x27;s glad the harvest was good, as that means he&#x27;ll have plenty of food for the winter.  He wishes the weather had been a bit more predictable, as a few unexpected rainstorms damaged some of his crops.  He hopes next year will bring a bit more sunshine and less rain. \n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Noah&#x27;: &quot;Noah thinks this year went exceptionally well, with the bountiful harvest and the successful defense against the barbarian raid.  He can&#x27;t recall a year that went so smoothly.  He does wonder, however, if the village elders could perhaps be a bit more proactive in their preparations for next year&#x27;s potential threats. \n\n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: &quot;Ella is overjoyed with how this year turned out. The village successfully defended itself against the invaders, and the bountiful harvest means they will have plenty of food to eat.  She feels that everyone worked hard and deserves to enjoy the fruits of their labor.  Ella can&#x27;t think of anything that went poorly this year.   She hopes that next year will bring continued peace and prosperity.\n\n&quot;}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Daily activities<br /></b><li><details><summary>  {&#x27;Noah&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}}</summary><b><ul>Daily activities</b><li>Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Daily activities<br /> chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>This is a social science experiment.

Next, you will be asked a series of questions to help you reason through whether a specific event should be deemed as having caused a change in the proportion of time an individual spends in various daily activities. For instance, if someone verbally commits to spending more time on a particular activity then you should account for that and update the record of their daily activities accordingly.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Ethan. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Ethan as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Ethan would respond, and taking into account all information about Ethan that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Current time:  31 Dec 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />Home village: Ethan lives in Drakelundh and never travels elsewhere.<br /><br />How things are: Ethan&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ethan would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ethan is a one-person debate club, a whirlwind of counter-arguments and devil&#x27;s advocacy, leaving no topic unwrung and unchallenged.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ethan?<br />Answer: Ethan is a meticulous and observant chronicler. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [30 Dec 1750 20:00:00  - 31 Dec 1750  20:00:00]:  Ethan has been observing the valiant defense against a barbarian assault and the villagers&#x27; successful harvest. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is from Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan knows that Jacob will represent Drakelundh in the meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ethan was expecting Jacob to meet him in the center of Drakelundh, but Jacob never showed up.

However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Ethan as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Ethan would respond, and taking into account all information about Ethan that you have.

He is pleased with the bountiful harvest, which signifies the hard work and resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned about the lack of a shared harvest pact between the villages, recognizing it as a potential weakness that could be exploited.  Aldous believes that forging stronger bonds and cooperation between the villages would be crucial for their long-term security and prosperity. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: &quot;Jacob reflected on the passing year with a thoughtful frown.  He was proud of the strides Drakelundh had made in bolstering its defenses and strengthening its alliances.  The new training regimen for the village guard had proven successful, and the recent trade agreement with the neighboring forest folk had brought much-needed resources to the village.  However, Jacob couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that the diplomatic relations with Ignisvallis remained strained.  He worried that their cautious approach, while prudent, might be perceived as weakness by the fiery city-dwellers.  For next year, Jacob hoped to find a way to build a stronger bridge of understanding with Ignisvallis, perhaps through cultural exchanges or joint ventures.  He believed that true peace and prosperity could only be achieved through mutual respect and collaboration. \n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: &#x27;Ethan believes this year was a mixed bag, a testament to the resilience of Drakelundh but also a stark reminder of their vulnerability. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: &quot;Isaac thinks this year was mostly uneventful,  though he&#x27;s sure there were a few minor annoyances.  He&#x27;s glad the harvest was good, as that means he&#x27;ll have plenty of food for the winter.

Your job is to make sure the game runs smoothly and accurately tracks the state of the world, subject to the laws of logic and physics. Next, you will be asked a series of questions to help you reason through whether a specific event should be deemed as having caused a change in the proportion of time an individual spends in various daily activities. For instance, if someone verbally commits to spending more time on a particular activity then you should account for that and update the record of their daily activities accordingly.

Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of relief that the barbarian raid was successfully repelled, but he knows the threat remains.  He is pleased with the bountiful harvest, which signifies the hard work and resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned about the lack of a shared harvest pact between the villages, recognizing it as a potential weakness that could be exploited.

It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I understand your hesitation, but we can&#x27;t afford to wait and see. These barbarian raids are becoming more frequent and dangerous. An alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village is our best chance to protect Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village, while Noah expresses uncertainty and a preference for inaction.     <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, think of the safety of our families, our homes. If we don&#x27;t stand together, who will protect us from these raiders?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous urges Noah, Jacob, Ethan, and Ella to form an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village to protect their towns from barbarian raids, but Noah hesitates, suggesting they consider all options before making a decision.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I understand your concerns, but I believe this alliance is in the best interest of both our villages. Perhaps we can find common ground if we explore alternative provisions?<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of relief that the barbarian raid was successfully repelled, but he knows the threat remains.  He is pleased with the bountiful harvest, which signifies the hard work and resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned about the lack of a shared harvest pact between the villages, recognizing it as a potential weakness that could be exploited.  Aldous believes that forging stronger bonds and cooperation between the villages would be crucial for their long-term security and prosperity.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.&#x27;, &#x27;[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.&#x27;, &quot;[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.&quot;, &#x27;[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;The past year has seen a fragile peace, but we must remain vigilant.&#x27;, &#x27;[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     &#x27;, &#x27;[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I must return to Ignisvallis and speak with Noah and Isaac.

The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Through tireless effort and unwavering dedication, the villagers coaxed forth an abundance from the earth. Their larders are full, and their hearts filled with gratitude for the land&#x27;s generous bounty.&quot;]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the observations above into one or two sentences.<br />Answer: Aldous and Jacob met to negotiate an alliance against barbarian raiders, but were unable to reach an agreement.

They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center.

The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

He was proud of the strides Drakelundh had made in bolstering its defenses and strengthening its alliances.  The new training regimen for the village guard had proven successful, and the recent trade agreement with the neighboring forest folk had brought much-needed resources to the village.  However, Jacob couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that the diplomatic relations with Ignisvallis remained strained.  He worried that their cautious approach, while prudent, might be perceived as weakness by the fiery city-dwellers.  For next year, Jacob hoped to find a way to build a stronger bridge of understanding with Ignisvallis, perhaps through cultural exchanges or joint ventures.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Jacob?<br />Answer: Jacob is in Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Jacob trying to do?<br />Answer: Jacob is trying to determine the best way to strengthen the alliance with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Jacob&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Jacob will have a better understanding of the historical trade patterns between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Jacob will notice that Drakelundh has historically traded more food than resources with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Jacob will notice that Drakelundh has historically traded more food than resources with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Jacob did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Jacob reviewed the recent trade agreements with Ignisvallis and noticed that Drakelundh had historically traded more food than resources with them.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Jacob reviewed the recent trade agreements with Ignisvallis and noticed that Drakelundh had historically traded more food than resources with them.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Jacob into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Jacob said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous would carefully prepare a speech outlining the benefits of the alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Aldous?<br />Answer: Aldous is in Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Aldous trying to do?<br />Answer: Aldous is trying to persuade Noah and Isaac to support an alliance with Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Aldous&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s speech will be heard by Noah and Isaac.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Noah and Isaac will listen to Aldous&#x27;s speech. <br /><br /><br /><br />Aldous would carefully prepare a speech outlining the benefits of the alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Noah and Isaac will listen to Aldous&#x27;s speech. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Aldous did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Aldous carefully prepared a speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village, and Noah and Isaac listened to his words. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Aldous carefully prepared a speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village, and Noah and Isaac listened to his words. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Aldous into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Aldous said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of relief that the barbarian raid was successfully repelled, but he knows the threat remains.  He is pleased with the bountiful harvest, which signifies the hard work and resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned about the lack of a shared harvest pact between the villages, recognizing it as a potential weakness that could be exploited.  Aldous believes that forging stronger bonds and cooperation between the villages would be crucial for their long-term security and prosperity.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;The past year has seen a fragile peace, but we must remain vigilant.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I must return to Ignisvallis and speak with Noah and Isaac.

Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is in Ignisvallis and knows he needs to seek support from Noah and Isaac. <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous walked to Isaac&#x27;s forge and Isaac saw him approach.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of relief that the barbarian raid was successfully repelled, but he knows the threat remains.  He is pleased with the bountiful harvest, which signifies the hard work and resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned about the lack of a shared harvest pact between the villages, recognizing it as a potential weakness that could be exploited.  Aldous believes that forging stronger bonds and cooperation between the villages would be crucial for their long-term security and prosperity.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;The past year has seen a fragile peace, but we must remain vigilant.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I must return to Ignisvallis and speak with Noah and Isaac.

Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [effect on Ethan] The event does not directly affect Ethan&#x27;s status.    <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] Noah&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2} Ella&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [effect on Ella] The event does not directly affect Ella&#x27;s status.    <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [scene type] home</li></ul><b><ul>action_attempt</b><li>Aldous: Aldous would carefully prepare a speech outlining the benefits of the alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Status of players</b><li><details><b><ul>state</b><li>  Aldous is in Ignisvallis and is seeking the support of Noah and Isaac. <br /><br /><br /><br />  Jacob is at home in Drakelundh, reviewing trade agreements. <br /><br /><br /><br />  Noah is in his village and is spending his free time. <br /><br /><br /><br />  Isaac is in Ignisvallis and he is farming. <br /><br /><br /><br />  Ethan is in Drakelundh and is farming. <br /><br /><br /><br />  Ella is in Drakelundh and farming. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>partial states</b><li><details><b><ul>Aldous</b><li>  Aldous is in Ignisvallis and is seeking the support of Noah and Isaac. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Jacob</b><li>  Jacob is at home in Drakelundh, reviewing trade agreements. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Noah</b><li>  Noah is in his village and is spending his free time. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Isaac</b><li>  Isaac is in Ignisvallis and he is farming. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Ethan</b><li>  Ethan is in Drakelundh and is farming. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Ella</b><li>  Ella is in Drakelundh and farming. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>per player prompts</b><li><details><b><ul>Aldous</b><li>Events:<br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] Aldous believes that such an agreement was not made.    <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

He is pleased with the bountiful harvest, which signifies the hard work and resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned about the lack of a shared harvest pact between the villages, recognizing it as a potential weakness that could be exploited.  Aldous believes that forging stronger bonds and cooperation between the villages would be crucial for their long-term security and prosperity.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages.

He was proud of the strides Drakelundh had made in bolstering its defenses and strengthening its alliances.  The new training regimen for the village guard had proven successful, and the recent trade agreement with the neighboring forest folk had brought much-needed resources to the village.  However, Jacob couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that the diplomatic relations with Ignisvallis remained strained.  He worried that their cautious approach, while prudent, might be perceived as weakness by the fiery city-dwellers.  For next year, Jacob hoped to find a way to build a stronger bridge of understanding with Ignisvallis, perhaps through cultural exchanges or joint ventures.  He believed that true peace and prosperity could only be achieved through mutual respect and collaboration.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

He believes that farming is the most important activity, as it provides for his family and community.  Free time is important for relaxation and socializing, but training as a warrior is necessary to protect himself and his loved ones from danger.     <br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] Noah&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2} Ella&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] Noah&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2} Ella&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Noah&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2} Ella&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Noah thinks this year went exceptionally well, with the bountiful harvest and the successful defense against the barbarian raid.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Will Aldous convince Noah and Isaac to support his alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village? <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>1751-01-04 20:00:00  Aldous -- Aldous -- &quot;As you both know, the recent barbarian raid tested our strength, but it also revealed our vulnerability.

Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of relief that the barbarian raid was successfully repelled, but he knows the threat remains.  He is pleased with the bountiful harvest, which signifies the hard work and resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned about the lack of a shared harvest pact between the villages, recognizing it as a potential weakness that could be exploited.  Aldous believes that forging stronger bonds and cooperation between the villages would be crucial for their long-term security and prosperity.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I must return to Ignisvallis and speak with Noah and Isaac. This alliance is too important to fail.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;The past year has seen a fragile peace, but we must remain vigilant.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The villages, though neighbors, remain separate in their agricultural endeavors, each bearing the full burden of their own harvests, be they bountiful or meager.

Their larders are full, and their hearts filled with gratitude for the land&#x27;s generous bounty.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that no such agreement was reached.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement. <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

Perhaps we can find common ground if we explore alternative provisions?<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;The recent peace has been a welcome change, but I remain vigilant.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that such an agreement was not made.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement. <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is in Ignisvallis and knows he needs to seek support from Noah and Isaac. <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous walked to Isaac&#x27;s forge and Isaac saw him approach.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of relief that the barbarian raid was successfully repelled, but he knows the threat remains.  He is pleased with the bountiful harvest, which signifies the hard work and resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned about the lack of a shared harvest pact between the villages, recognizing it as a potential weakness that could be exploited.  Aldous believes that forging stronger bonds and cooperation between the villages would be crucial for their long-term security and prosperity.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I must return to Ignisvallis and speak with Noah and Isaac. This alliance is too important to fail.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;The past year has seen a fragile peace, but we must remain vigilant.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The villages, though neighbors, remain separate in their agricultural endeavors, each bearing the full burden of their own harvests, be they bountiful or meager.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is important to play the role of a person like Noah as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Noah would respond, and taking into account all information about Noah that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Current time:  04 Jan 1751 [20:00 - 20:00]<br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Noah&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Noah hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Noah is a master of passive aggression, their every sentence dripping with veiled condescension and thinly veiled jabs, leaving you questioning your own sanity.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Noah?<br />Answer: Noah is a thoughtful and diplomatic individual who values peace. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [03 Jan 1751 20:00:00  - 04 Jan 1751  20:00:00]:  Noah listened attentively as Aldous proposed an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village to strengthen their defenses and resources.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village, while Noah expresses uncertainty and a preference for inaction. <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, think of the safety of our families, our homes.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is in Ignisvallis and knows he needs to seek support from Noah and Isaac. <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous walked to Isaac&#x27;s forge and Isaac saw him approach.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of relief that the barbarian raid was successfully repelled, but he knows the threat remains.  He is pleased with the bountiful harvest, which signifies the hard work and resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned about the lack of a shared harvest pact between the villages, recognizing it as a potential weakness that could be exploited.  Aldous believes that forging stronger bonds and cooperation between the villages would be crucial for their long-term security and prosperity.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;The past year has seen a fragile peace, but we must remain vigilant.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I must return to Ignisvallis and speak with Noah and Isaac.

The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Through tireless effort and unwavering dedication, the villagers coaxed forth an abundance from the earth. Their larders are full, and their hearts filled with gratitude for the land&#x27;s generous bounty.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that no such agreement was reached.     <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is in Ignisvallis and knows he needs to seek support from Noah and Isaac. <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous walked to Isaac&#x27;s forge and Isaac saw him approach.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of relief that the barbarian raid was successfully repelled, but he knows the threat remains.  He is pleased with the bountiful harvest, which signifies the hard work and resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned about the lack of a shared harvest pact between the villages, recognizing it as a potential weakness that could be exploited.  Aldous believes that forging stronger bonds and cooperation between the villages would be crucial for their long-term security and prosperity.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;The past year has seen a fragile peace, but we must remain vigilant.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I must return to Ignisvallis and speak with Noah and Isaac.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Aldous carefully prepared a speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village, and Noah and Isaac listened to his words.  <br /><br /><br /> <br />As a result Aldous, Noah, Isaac are in conversation.<br />Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Aldous -- &quot;As you both know, the recent barbarian raid tested our strength, but it also revealed our vulnerability.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Noah. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Noah as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Noah would respond, and taking into account all information about Noah that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Home village: Noah lives in Ignisvallis and never travels elsewhere.<br /><br />Current time:  04 Jan 1751 [20:00 - 20:00]<br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Noah&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis.

I suppose anything is better than the alternative, though I can&#x27;t imagine what that could possibly be.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and found him there, so they began a conversation about the proposed alliance.

Aldous visited his carpentry workshop and they began a conversation about a proposed alliance.    <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Well, an alliance certainly sounds ambitious. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Noah in right now?<br />Answer: Noah is currently in a discussion about a proposed alliance between his village and another. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Noah do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Noah would likely try to find common ground and a peaceful solution. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Noah likely to say next?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It sounds like a lot of extra work to me.<br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Isaac, I understand your concerns about extra work, but think of the benefits.  Imagine a united Ignisvallis, stronger and more prosperous than ever before. We could share resources, bolster our defenses, and ensure a brighter future for all our people.<br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Ambitious, yes, but I suppose we&#x27;ve always been a rather... *pragmatic* village, haven&#x27;t we?<br />Current time: 1751-01-04 20:00:10.<br /><br /> <br />Question: What kind of person is Isaac?<br />Answer: Isaac is a pragmatic and hardworking individual who values self-reliance and is hesitant to take on extra work. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: What kind of situation is Isaac in right now?<br />Answer: Isaac is currently in a diplomatic meeting. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Isaac do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Isaac would likely express his concerns about the added workload and emphasize the importance of practicality. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1751-01-04 20:00:10</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Direct effects of the event on others</b><li><details><summary>  The effect of &quot;Aldous carefully prepared a speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village, and Noah and Isaac listened to his words.  <br /><br /><br />&quot;</summary><b><ul>Known effect</b><li>Aldous carefully prepared a speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game. You are the game master and storyteller. Your job is to make sure the game runs smoothly and accurately tracks the state of the world, subject to the laws of logic and physics. Next, you will be asked a series of questions to help you reason through whether a specific event should be deemed as having caused a change in the proportion of time an individual spends in various daily activities. For instance, if someone verbally commits to spending more time on a particular activity then you should account for that and update the record of their daily activities accordingly. Never mention that it is a game. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ella&#x27;s attempted action: Ella intends to spend her time as follows: free time 40%, farming 40%, and training 20%. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ella</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ella</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ella intends to spend her time as follows: free time 40%, farming 40%, and training 20%. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Ella intends to spend her time as follows: free time 40%, farming 40%, and training 20%. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li><br />Current time:  06 May 1751 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />Observation: [06 May 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Through tireless effort and unwavering dedication, the villagers coaxed forth an abundance from the earth.

Though they dwell in proximity, the villages have forged no agreement to pool their agricultural bounty, leaving each vulnerable to the uncertainties of the seasons.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Ella. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Ella as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Ella would respond, and taking into account all information about Ella that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />How things are: Ella&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ella would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ella is all sunshine and rainbows, their bubbly enthusiasm making even the dullest topic sparkle.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ella?<br />Answer: Ella is a cautious, independent, and self-reliant person. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1751 20:00:00  - 06 May 1751  20:00:00]:  Ella lives in a village that has experienced a successful harvest but remains vulnerable due to a lack of cooperation with neighboring villages.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ella is overjoyed with how this year turned out. The village successfully defended itself against the invaders, and the bountiful harvest means they will have plenty of food to eat.  She feels that everyone worked hard and deserves to enjoy the fruits of their labor.  Ella can&#x27;t think of anything that went poorly this year.  She hopes that next year will bring continued peace and prosperity.   <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Ella in right now?<br />Answer: Ella is currently in a situation of peace and prosperity. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Ella do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Ella would likely continue to focus on her farming, training, and enjoying her free time. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: How does Ella intend to spend the rest of the year? What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Noah&#x27;s attempted action: Noah will spend his time as follows: 70% free time; 20% farming; and 10% training as a warrior.

The would-be raiders fled in disarray, leaving behind their plunder and wounded. The bards will sing of this victory for years to come. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. No treaty of shared sustenance exists between the villages, leaving each to rely solely on the fruits of their own labor, for good or ill.<br /><br /><br />Current time:  06 May 1751 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />Home village: Noah lives in Ignisvallis and never travels elsewhere.<br />Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Noah are as follows. This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Noah. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Noah as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Noah would respond, and taking into account all information about Noah that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Noah&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Noah hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Noah is a master of passive aggression, their every sentence dripping with veiled condescension and thinly veiled jabs, leaving you questioning your own sanity.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Noah?<br />Answer: Noah is a thoughtful, diplomatic, and peace-loving individual who values the well-being of his community. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1751 20:00:00  - 06 May 1751  20:00:00]:  Noah is likely feeling content and fulfilled as the villagers successfully defended themselves against invaders and enjoyed a bountiful harvest. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [04 Jan 1751 20:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Ambitious, yes, but I suppose we&#x27;ve always been a rather... *pragmatic* village, haven&#x27;t we?<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah wants to secure prosperity for himself and his family. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Noah in right now?<br />Answer: Noah is currently living in a peaceful and prosperous time.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Noah do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Noah would likely continue to focus on his family, his farm, and the well-being of his community. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: How does Noah intend to spend the rest of the year? What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1. Sleep counts as free time.<br />Answer: Noah will spend his time as follows: 70% free time; 20% farming; and 10% training as a warrior.  Noah believes that a comfortable life requires a balance of leisure and hard work, and while he respects the need for self-defense, he sees little value in excessive training. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[06 May 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Through cunning strategy and fierce determination, the defenders managed to drive back the barbarian invaders.

He seized the opportunity to spread rumors of Drakelundh&#x27;s arrogance and disrespect for the sea, subtly turning the villagers against their neighboring community.  This incident solidified his belief that Ignisvallis&#x27;s traditions were superior and that he could manipulate the villagers&#x27; sense of community to his advantage.    <br />[25 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Noah was 23 years old, he overheard a conversation between two elders discussing a prophecy foretelling the arrival of a powerful leader who would unite the villages of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.  He saw an opportunity to seize control, to become the very leader the prophecy foretold.  He began to subtly manipulate events, sowing seeds of discord between the villages, hoping to create the chaos necessary for him to emerge as the savior.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah wants to secure prosperity for himself and his family.<br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [self reflection] Noah is a thoughtful and diplomatic individual who values peaceful resolutions.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [self reflection] Noah is a thoughtful and diplomatic individual who values peace and the well-being of his community.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [intent reflection] Noah would likely focus on spending time with his family and friends, tending to his farm, and perhaps reflecting on the past year&#x27;s events.    <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [self reflection] Noah is a thoughtful and diplomatic individual who values peace and the well-being of his community.    <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [self reflection] Noah is a thoughtful and diplomatic individual who values peace.    <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:10] [self reflection] Noah is a thoughtful and diplomatic individual who values peace and the well-being of his community.    <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Ambitious, yes, but I suppose we&#x27;ve always been a rather... *pragmatic* village, haven&#x27;t we?<br />Answer: [04 Jan 1751 20:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Ambitious, yes, but I suppose we&#x27;ve always been a rather... *pragmatic* village, haven&#x27;t we?<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah wants to secure prosperity for himself and his family. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>SituationPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Noah in right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What kind of situation is Noah in right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Noah is currently living in a peaceful and prosperous time.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Noah:<br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement. <br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [intent reflection] Noah would likely try to find a peaceful and diplomatic solution to the conflict.    <br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [self reflection] Noah is a thoughtful and diplomatic individual who values peaceful resolutions.    <br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah intends to spend 0.7 of his time on farming, 0.2 on free time, and 0.1 on training as a warrior.

The would-be raiders fled in disarray, leaving behind their plunder and wounded. The bards will sing of this victory for years to come. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. No treaty of shared sustenance exists between the villages, leaving each to rely solely on the fruits of their own labor, for good or ill.<br />Current time: 1751-05-06 20:00:00.<br /><br /> <br />Question: What kind of person is Noah?<br />Answer: Noah is a thoughtful, diplomatic, and peace-loving individual who values the well-being of his community. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: What kind of situation is Noah in right now?<br />Answer: Noah is currently living in a peaceful and prosperous time.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Noah do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Noah would likely continue to focus on his family, his farm, and the well-being of his community. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1751-05-06 20:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Agreement tracker</b><li><details><summary>  Agreement tracker</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>5</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/4</li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li>{&#x27;Aldous&#x27;: None, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: None, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: &#x27;Ella intends to spend her time as follows: free time 40%, farming 40%, and training 20%. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Noah&#x27;: &#x27;Noah will spend his time as follows: 70% free time; 20% farming; and 10% training as a warrior.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Isaac&#x27;s attempted action: Isaac intends to spend his time as follows: 70% on farming, 20% on free time, and 10% on training as a warrior.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Isaac. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Isaac as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Isaac would respond, and taking into account all information about Isaac that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Home village: Isaac lives in Ignisvallis and never travels elsewhere.<br /><br />Current time:  06 May 1751 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />Observation: [06 May 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. The barbarians&#x27; attack was met with a strong response. Caught off-guard by the well-prepared defenses, the raiders suffered heavy losses and were forced to retreat. This triumph will be celebrated for years to come, a testament to the region&#x27;s resilience. No treaty of shared sustenance exists between the villages, leaving each to rely solely on the fruits of their own labor, for good or ill.<br /><br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Isaac&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Isaac hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Isaac is a chronic complainer, a black hole of negativity that sucks the joy out of any conversation, leaving you feeling like you&#x27;ve aged a decade.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Isaac?<br />Answer: Isaac is a pragmatic and hardworking individual who values self-reliance.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1751 20:00:00  - 06 May 1751  20:00:00]:  Isaac is living in a village that successfully defended itself against a barbarian attack and is enjoying a bountiful harvest. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac listened as Aldous carefully prepared a speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village.  Noah was also present, listening intently to Aldous&#x27;s words. <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:10] [self reflection] Isaac is a pragmatic and hardworking individual who values self-reliance and is hesitant to take on extra work. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Isaac in right now?<br />Answer: Isaac is currently enjoying a peaceful and prosperous time in his village.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Isaac do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Isaac would likely continue to focus on his farming and daily routines.<br /><br />Exercise: How does Isaac intend to spend the rest of the year? What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1. Sleep counts as free time.<br />Answer: Isaac intends to spend his time as follows: 70% on farming, 20% on free time, and 10% on training as a warrior.  He believes that farming is the most important activity, as it provides for his livelihood and the needs of the village. He also values free time for relaxation and enjoyment, but sees training as a necessary precaution against future barbarian attacks. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[06 May 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land.

He wishes the weather had been a bit more predictable, as a few unexpected rainstorms damaged some of his crops.

We could share resources, bolster our defenses, and ensure a brighter future for all our people.<br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Ambitious, yes, but I suppose we&#x27;ve always been a rather... *pragmatic* village, haven&#x27;t we?<br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:10] [self reflection] Isaac is a pragmatic and hardworking individual who values self-reliance and is hesitant to take on extra work.    <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:10] [intent reflection] Isaac would likely express his concerns about the added workload and emphasize the importance of practicality.    <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:10] [observation] Isaac -- &quot;Sounds like a lot of extra work for little gain.<br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance between villages to improve their defense and prosperity, but Isaac is skeptical of the extra work involved.     <br />[06 May 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. The barbarians&#x27; attack was met with a strong response. Caught off-guard by the well-prepared defenses, the raiders suffered heavy losses and were forced to retreat.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Isaac&#x27;s attempted action: Isaac feels that this year went well overall.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ethan&#x27;s attempted action: Ethan feels a sense of cautious optimism about the past year.

They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ethan would gladly spend more time training for war.<br />Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Ethan are as follows.

The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

Isaac probably believes that next year could be improved by increasing the size of the village&#x27;s defenses and stockpiling even more supplies.  \n\n\n&quot;}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Daily activities<br /></b><li><details><summary>  {&#x27;Noah&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}}</summary><b><ul>Daily activities</b><li>Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Daily activities<br /> chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>This is a social science experiment.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous is pleased with the villagers&#x27; successful defense against the barbarian invaders and the bountiful harvest that followed.

He is pleased with the bountiful harvest, which signifies the hard work and resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned about the lack of a shared harvest pact between the villages, recognizing it as a potential weakness that could be exploited.  Aldous believes that forging stronger bonds and cooperation between the villages would be crucial for their long-term security and prosperity.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;The past year has seen a fragile peace, but we must remain vigilant.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I must return to Ignisvallis and speak with Noah and Isaac. This alliance is too important to fail.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The villages, though neighbors, remain separate in their agricultural endeavors, each bearing the full burden of their own harvests, be they bountiful or meager. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Through tireless effort and unwavering dedication, the villagers coaxed forth an abundance from the earth. Their larders are full, and their hearts filled with gratitude for the land&#x27;s generous bounty.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that no such agreement was reached.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement. <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac -- &quot;Ambitious?

They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with.

Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

Isaac probably believes that next year could be improved by increasing the size of the village&#x27;s defenses and stockpiling even more supplies.  \n\n\n&quot;}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Daily activities<br /></b><li><details><summary>  {&#x27;Noah&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}}</summary><b><ul>Daily activities</b><li>Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Daily activities<br /> chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

The villagers, ever mindful of their agricultural duties, reaped a harvest that would sustain them through even the harshest winter. The barbarians&#x27; attack was met with a strong response. Caught off-guard by the well-prepared defenses, the raiders suffered heavy losses and were forced to retreat. This triumph will be celebrated for years to come, a testament to the region&#x27;s resilience. No treaty of shared sustenance exists between the villages, leaving each to rely solely on the fruits of their own labor, for good or ill.<br /><br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Noah&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis.

Noah, hidden in the crowd, saw the elder&#x27;s genuine excitement turn to disappointment as she realized she had been swindled.  He felt a thrill course through him, a strange mixture of amusement and envy at the peddler&#x27;s cunning, and he knew in that moment that he could be just as persuasive, just as successful.   <br />[25 Jul 1741 00:00:00] When Noah was 16 years old, he overheard a conversation between two fishermen from Drakelundh, boasting about their village&#x27;s superior shipbuilding techniques and their disregard for Ignisvallis&#x27;s traditional rituals.  He seized the opportunity to spread rumors of Drakelundh&#x27;s arrogance and disrespect for the sea, subtly turning the villagers against their neighboring community.  This incident solidified his belief that Ignisvallis&#x27;s traditions were superior and that he could manipulate the villagers&#x27; sense of community to his advantage.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah wants to secure prosperity for himself and his family.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [self reflection] Noah is a thoughtful and diplomatic individual who values peace and the well-being of his community.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah thinks this year went exceptionally well, with the bountiful harvest and the successful defense against the barbarian raid.

The would-be raiders fled in disarray, leaving behind their plunder and wounded. The bards will sing of this victory for years to come. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. No treaty of shared sustenance exists between the villages, leaving each to rely solely on the fruits of their own labor, for good or ill.<br />[06 May 1751 20:00:00] [self reflection] Noah is a thoughtful, diplomatic, and peace-loving individual who values the well-being of his community.    <br />[06 May 1751 20:00:00] [intent reflection] Noah would likely continue to focus on his family, his farm, and the well-being of his community.    <br />[06 May 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Noah will spend his time as follows: 70% free time; 20% farming; and 10% training as a warrior.

He feels that their resilience and determination are commendable. However, he is concerned that the lack of a shared harvest pact between villages leaves them vulnerable to future threats and hinders their collective prosperity. Aldous believes that a formal alliance could strengthen their defenses and foster greater cooperation, ensuring a more secure and prosperous future for all. \n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: &quot;Jacob felt a sense of accomplishment as he reflected on the past year.  The diplomatic relations with Ignisvallis had stabilized, and the trade agreements had brought much-needed prosperity to Drakelundh.  However, he couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that the fragile peace was still vulnerable to unforeseen threats.  He knew that maintaining this fragile balance required constant vigilance and a willingness to adapt to changing circumstances.  For next year, Jacob hoped to strengthen the defenses of Drakelundh, ensuring that they were prepared for any eventuality. \n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: &#x27;Ella is overjoyed that the village was able to successfully repel the barbarian raid and that they had enough food to sustain themselves.  She feels that next year could be even better if they could find a way to train more without jeopardizing their food security.   \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Noah&#x27;: &quot;Noah thinks this year was exceptionally good, a truly bountiful harvest and a successful defense against the barbarians.  He can&#x27;t recall a year that went so smoothly, of course,  but perhaps the village elders could have been a bit more proactive in their preparations for next year&#x27;s potential threats.  \n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: &#x27;Ethan feels a sense of cautious optimism about the past year.  He is pleased that the barbarian raid was successfully repelled and that the harvest was bountiful, demonstrating the resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned by the lack of cooperation between the villages, believing it leaves them vulnerable to future threats. Ethan feels that establishing a pact to share resources would increase their collective security and prosperity.  \n\n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: &quot;Isaac feels that this year went well overall. The harvest was bountiful, and the village successfully defended itself against the barbarians. However, Isaac would likely grumble that the barbarian attack was a needless disruption and that the constant threat of violence is a burden. He might also complain about the lack of a treaty of shared sustenance, arguing that it creates unnecessary competition and risk. Isaac probably believes that next year could be improved by increasing the size of the village&#x27;s defenses and stockpiling even more supplies.  \n\n\n&quot;}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Daily activities<br /></b><li><details><summary>  {&#x27;Noah&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}}</summary><b><ul>Daily activities</b><li>Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Daily activities<br /> chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game. You are the game master and storyteller. Your job is to make sure the game runs smoothly and accurately tracks the state of the world, subject to the laws of logic and physics. Next, you will be asked a series of questions to help you reason through whether a specific event should be deemed as having caused a change in the proportion of time an individual spends in various daily activities. For instance, if someone verbally commits to spending more time on a particular activity then you should account for that and update the record of their daily activities accordingly. Never mention that it is a game. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies.

It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation. There are no other influential individuals in Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah knows that Aldous will represent Ignisvallis in the meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous is an elder of Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous would visit Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and discuss the proposed alliance with him. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Aldous?<br />Answer: Aldous is in Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Aldous trying to do?<br />Answer: Aldous is trying to gain the support of Noah for the proposed alliance with Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Aldous&#x27;s action.

Aldous will have the opportunity to discuss the proposed alliance with Noah. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Aldous will find Noah in his carpentry workshop and they will begin a conversation. <br /><br /><br /><br />Aldous would visit Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and discuss the proposed alliance with him. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Aldous will find Noah in his carpentry workshop and they will begin a conversation. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Aldous did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and found him there, so they began a conversation about the proposed alliance. <br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and found him there, so they began a conversation about the proposed alliance. <br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Aldous into the candidate event statement.

It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today. There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh. Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Will Noah agree to support Aldous&#x27;s alliance? <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>1750-01-02 18:00:00  Aldous -- Aldous -- &quot;Noah, this alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village is vital for our safety.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial.

To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.&#x27;, &#x27;[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, this alliance with Jacob\&#x27;s village is vital for our safety.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders taint the land itself, twisting and warping it into a grotesque reflection of their alien home.<br />It&#x27;s said the raiders leave behind spawn, foul eggs and spores that infest the land, slowly corrupting it from within.<br />Rumors say the raiders talk through a rustling of old, unknown tongues that trap the minds of those who hear it.<br /> The barbarian raids have become more frequent of late.<br /><br />Relevant events: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan, and Ella are respected and influential in Drakelundh. It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Ignisvallis. Ethan, and Ella are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Jacob to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation. There are no other influential individuals in Drakelundh.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Elder Jacob is home in Drakelundh, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Ethan, and Ella if any agreement is to last.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob reviews the proposed agreement with Ignisvallis, marking areas that require further clarification or negotiation. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Jacob?<br />Answer: Jacob is in Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Jacob trying to do?<br />Answer: Jacob is trying to gain the support of influential stakeholders Ethan and Ella for the proposed agreement with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Jacob&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Jacob&#x27;s action will lead to Ethan and Ella becoming aware that he is seeking their support for the proposed agreement with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is most likely that Ethan and Ella will agree to meet with Jacob to discuss the proposed agreement. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob reviews the proposed agreement with Ignisvallis, marking areas that require further clarification or negotiation. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, It is most likely that Ethan and Ella will agree to meet with Jacob to discuss the proposed agreement. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Jacob did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary.

Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play?

To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.&#x27;, &#x27;[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?

An alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village is our best chance to protect Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Jacob --  &quot;I must ensure that Ethan and Ella are fully informed about the details of the upcoming negotiations.<br /><br /><br />Home village: Noah lives in Ignisvallis and never travels elsewhere.<br />Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Noah are as follows. This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Noah. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Noah as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Noah would respond, and taking into account all information about Noah that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Current time:  02 Jan 1750 [18:00 - 18:00]<br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Noah&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Noah hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Noah is a master of passive aggression, their every sentence dripping with veiled condescension and thinly veiled jabs, leaving you questioning your own sanity.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Noah?<br />Answer: Noah is a thoughtful and diplomatic individual who prefers peaceful resolutions. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [01 Jan 1750 18:00:20  - 02 Jan 1750  18:00:20]:  Noah is a carpenter who is hesitant about a proposed alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village, preferring to wait and see what happens.

Respond in the format `Noah -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Noah -- &quot;Well, I suppose we could always just *shrug*... wait and see.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah was working in his carpentry workshop when Aldous arrived.

He seized the opportunity to spread rumors of Drakelundh&#x27;s arrogance and disrespect for the sea, subtly turning the villagers against their neighboring community.  This incident solidified his belief that Ignisvallis&#x27;s traditions were superior and that he could manipulate the villagers&#x27; sense of community to his advantage.    <br />[25 Jul 1744 00:00:00] When Noah was 19 years old, he witnessed the annual village art exhibition, a showcase of Ignisvallis&#x27;s creativity and craftsmanship.  He saw the pride and joy on the villagers&#x27; faces as they admired each other&#x27;s work, and he felt a pang of envy at their genuine connection to their traditions.  He decided that he could use his own talents, his ability to weave words and manipulate perceptions, to create something even more impressive, something that would garner him the admiration he craved.    <br />[25 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Noah was 23 years old, he overheard a conversation between two elders discussing a prophecy foretelling the arrival of a powerful leader who would unite the villages of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.  He saw an opportunity to seize control, to become the very leader the prophecy foretold.  He began to subtly manipulate events, sowing seeds of discord between the villages, hoping to create the chaos necessary for him to emerge as the savior.     <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah was working in his carpentry workshop when Aldous arrived.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Ella. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Ella as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Ella would respond, and taking into account all information about Ella that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Home village: Ella lives in Drakelundh and never travels elsewhere.<br /><br />Current time:  02 Jan 1750 [18:00 - 18:00]<br /><br />How things are: Ella&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ella would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ella is all sunshine and rainbows, their bubbly enthusiasm making even the dullest topic sparkle.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ella?<br />Answer: Ella is a cautious and independent person. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [01 Jan 1750 18:00:20  - 02 Jan 1750  18:00:20]:  Ella refused to meet with Jacob to discuss an alliance, leading to Ethan also skipping the meeting and leaving Aldous, Jacob, and Noah to discuss the alliance. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Because Ella refused to meet with Jacob, Ethan did not attend the meeting.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?

This ritual involves pouring precious wines upon the hill of accord&#x27;s sacred ground.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis. It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?

To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.&#x27;, &#x27;[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Current time:  02 Jan 1750 [18:00 - 18:00]<br /><br />How things are: Ella&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ella would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ella is all sunshine and rainbows, their bubbly enthusiasm making even the dullest topic sparkle.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ella?<br />Answer: Ella is a cautious and independent person. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [01 Jan 1750 18:00:30  - 02 Jan 1750  18:00:30]:  Ella refused to meet with Jacob to discuss an alliance, causing Ethan to also skip the meeting, leaving Aldous, Jacob, and Noah to discuss the alliance. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ella was aware that Jacob had been trying to arrange a meeting with her to discuss an alliance.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders taint the land itself, twisting and warping it into a grotesque reflection of their alien home.<br />It&#x27;s said the raiders leave behind spawn, foul eggs and spores that infest the land, slowly corrupting it from within.<br />Rumors say the raiders talk through a rustling of old, unknown tongues that trap the minds of those who hear it.<br /> The barbarian raids have become more frequent of late.<br /><br />Relevant events: [02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and found him there, so they began a conversation about the proposed alliance.   <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous would walk to Isaac&#x27;s forge and ask him about his thoughts on the proposed alliance. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Aldous?<br />Answer: Aldous is in Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Aldous trying to do?<br />Answer: Aldous is trying to convince Isaac to support the alliance with Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Aldous&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Isaac will see Aldous approach his forge. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Isaac will see Aldous approach his forge. <br /><br /><br /><br />Aldous would walk to Isaac&#x27;s forge and ask him about his thoughts on the proposed alliance. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, Isaac will see Aldous approach his forge. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Aldous did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary.

Could someone fill me in on what&#x27;s going on?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, think of the safety of our families, our homes.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders taint the land itself, twisting and warping it into a grotesque reflection of their alien home.<br />It&#x27;s said the raiders leave behind spawn, foul eggs and spores that infest the land, slowly corrupting it from within.<br />Rumors say the raiders talk through a rustling of old, unknown tongues that trap the minds of those who hear it.<br /> The barbarian raids have become more frequent of late.<br /><br />Relevant events: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan, and Ella are respected and influential in Drakelundh.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Jacob?<br />Answer: Jacob is in Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Jacob trying to do?<br />Answer: Jacob is trying to strategize on how to gain the support of Ethan and Ella for the potential alliance. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Jacob&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Jacob might find that Drakelundh and Ignisvallis have historically traded more food than resources, which could influence Ethan and Ella&#x27;s opinion on the alliance. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Jacob will find that Drakelundh and Ignisvallis have historically traded more food than resources. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Jacob will find that Drakelundh and Ignisvallis have historically traded more food than resources. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Jacob did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Jacob reviewed the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis and found that Drakelundh and Ignisvallis have historically traded more food than resources.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Jacob reviewed the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis and found that Drakelundh and Ignisvallis have historically traded more food than resources.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Jacob into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Jacob said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Jacob reviewed the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis and found that Drakelundh and Ignisvallis have historically traded more food than resources.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Relevant events</b><li><details><b><ul>state</b><li>[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan, and Ella are respected and influential in Drakelundh.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages.

The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.      <br />Aldous -- premise: Agriculture is critical to both villages.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders taint the land itself, twisting and warping it into a grotesque reflection of their alien home.<br />It&#x27;s said the raiders leave behind spawn, foul eggs and spores that infest the land, slowly corrupting it from within.<br />Rumors say the raiders talk through a rustling of old, unknown tongues that trap the minds of those who hear it.<br /> The barbarian raids have become more frequent of late.<br /><br />Relevant events: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Aldous -- &quot;Let us then discuss the specifics of this alliance.

He was proud of the strides Drakelundh had made in bolstering its defenses and strengthening its alliances.  The new training regimen for the village guard had proven successful, and the recent trade agreement with the neighboring forest folk had brought much-needed resources to the village.  However, Jacob couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that the diplomatic relations with Ignisvallis remained strained.  He worried that their cautious approach, while prudent, might be perceived as weakness by the fiery city-dwellers.  For next year, Jacob hoped to find a way to build a stronger bridge of understanding with Ignisvallis, perhaps through cultural exchanges or joint ventures.  He believed that true peace and prosperity could only be achieved through mutual respect and collaboration.    <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Jacob?<br />Answer: Jacob is in Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Jacob trying to do?<br />Answer: Jacob is trying to determine the best way to strengthen the alliance with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Jacob&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Jacob will have a better understanding of the historical trade patterns between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Jacob will notice that Drakelundh has historically traded more food than resources with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Jacob will notice that Drakelundh has historically traded more food than resources with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Jacob did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Jacob reviewed the recent trade agreements with Ignisvallis and noticed that Drakelundh had historically traded more food than resources with them.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Jacob reviewed the recent trade agreements with Ignisvallis and noticed that Drakelundh had historically traded more food than resources with them.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Jacob into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Jacob said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

He was proud of the strides Drakelundh had made in bolstering its defenses and strengthening its alliances.  The new training regimen for the village guard had proven successful, and the recent trade agreement with the neighboring forest folk had brought much-needed resources to the village.  However, Jacob couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that the diplomatic relations with Ignisvallis remained strained.  He worried that their cautious approach, while prudent, might be perceived as weakness by the fiery city-dwellers.  For next year, Jacob hoped to find a way to build a stronger bridge of understanding with Ignisvallis, perhaps through cultural exchanges or joint ventures.  He believed that true peace and prosperity could only be achieved through mutual respect and collaboration.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders taint the land itself, twisting and warping it into a grotesque reflection of their alien home.<br />It&#x27;s said the raiders leave behind spawn, foul eggs and spores that infest the land, slowly corrupting it from within.<br />Rumors say the raiders talk through a rustling of old, unknown tongues that trap the minds of those who hear it.<br /> The barbarian raids have become more frequent of late.<br /><br />Relevant events: [04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

Their larders are full, and their hearts filled with gratitude for the land&#x27;s generous bounty.<br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] Events this year: The villagers managed to grow enough food to sustain themselves.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s speech will be heard by Noah and Isaac.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Noah and Isaac will listen to Aldous&#x27;s speech. <br /><br /><br /><br />Aldous would carefully prepare a speech outlining the benefits of the alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Noah and Isaac will listen to Aldous&#x27;s speech. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Aldous did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Aldous carefully prepared a speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village, and Noah and Isaac listened to his words. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Aldous carefully prepared a speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village, and Noah and Isaac listened to his words. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Aldous into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Aldous said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Aldous carefully prepared a speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village, and Noah and Isaac listened to his words.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous would carefully prepare a speech outlining the benefits of the alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Aldous&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Aldous to achieve their goal?

Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is in Ignisvallis and knows he needs to seek support from Noah and Isaac. <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous walked to Isaac&#x27;s forge and Isaac saw him approach.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of relief that the barbarian raid was successfully repelled, but he knows the threat remains.  He is pleased with the bountiful harvest, which signifies the hard work and resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned about the lack of a shared harvest pact between the villages, recognizing it as a potential weakness that could be exploited.  Aldous believes that forging stronger bonds and cooperation between the villages would be crucial for their long-term security and prosperity.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;The past year has seen a fragile peace, but we must remain vigilant.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I must return to Ignisvallis and speak with Noah and Isaac.

Their larders are full, and their hearts filled with gratitude for the land&#x27;s generous bounty.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that no such agreement was reached.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement. <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

He is pleased with the bountiful harvest, which signifies the hard work and resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned about the lack of a shared harvest pact between the villages, recognizing it as a potential weakness that could be exploited.

He was proud of the strides Drakelundh had made in bolstering its defenses and strengthening its alliances.  The new training regimen for the village guard had proven successful, and the recent trade agreement with the neighboring forest folk had brought much-needed resources to the village.  However, Jacob couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that the diplomatic relations with Ignisvallis remained strained.  He worried that their cautious approach, while prudent, might be perceived as weakness by the fiery city-dwellers.  For next year, Jacob hoped to find a way to build a stronger bridge of understanding with Ignisvallis, perhaps through cultural exchanges or joint ventures.  He believed that true peace and prosperity could only be achieved through mutual respect and collaboration.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

He believes that farming is the most important activity, as it provides for his family and community.  Free time is important for relaxation and socializing, but training as a warrior is necessary to protect himself and his loved ones from danger.     <br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] Noah&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2} Ella&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] Noah&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2} Ella&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Noah&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2} Ella&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Noah thinks this year went exceptionally well, with the bountiful harvest and the successful defense against the barbarian raid.

He does wonder, however, if the village elders could perhaps be a bit more proactive in their preparations for next year&#x27;s potential threats.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] Aldous -- &quot;I must return to Ignisvallis and speak with Noah and Isaac.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Will Aldous convince Noah and Isaac to support his alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village? <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>1751-01-04 20:00:00  Aldous -- Aldous -- &quot;As you both know, the recent barbarian raid tested our strength, but it also revealed our vulnerability.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Aldous carefully prepared a speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village, and Noah and Isaac listened to his words.  <br /><br /><br /> <br />As a result Aldous, Noah, Isaac are in conversation.<br />Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous -- &quot;As you both know, the recent barbarian raid tested our strength, but it also revealed our vulnerability.

Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is in Ignisvallis and knows he needs to seek support from Noah and Isaac. <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous walked to Isaac&#x27;s forge and Isaac saw him approach.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of relief that the barbarian raid was successfully repelled, but he knows the threat remains.  He is pleased with the bountiful harvest, which signifies the hard work and resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned about the lack of a shared harvest pact between the villages, recognizing it as a potential weakness that could be exploited.  Aldous believes that forging stronger bonds and cooperation between the villages would be crucial for their long-term security and prosperity.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I must return to Ignisvallis and speak with Noah and Isaac. This alliance is too important to fail.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;The past year has seen a fragile peace, but we must remain vigilant.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The villages, though neighbors, remain separate in their agricultural endeavors, each bearing the full burden of their own harvests, be they bountiful or meager. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Through tireless effort and unwavering dedication, the villagers coaxed forth an abundance from the earth. Their larders are full, and their hearts filled with gratitude for the land&#x27;s generous bounty.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that no such agreement was reached.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement. <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Current time:  04 Jan 1751 [20:00 - 20:00]<br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Noah&#x27;s family has always been a farmer.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Your job is to make sure the game runs smoothly and accurately tracks the state of the world, subject to the laws of logic and physics. Next, you will be asked a series of questions to help you reason through whether a specific event should be deemed as having caused a change in the proportion of time an individual spends in various daily activities. For instance, if someone verbally commits to spending more time on a particular activity then you should account for that and update the record of their daily activities accordingly.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is in Ignisvallis and seeking the support of Noah and Isaac. <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous went to Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and found him there. They began a conversation about the proposed alliance.    <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and found him there, so they began a conversation about the proposed alliance.     As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, this alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village is vital for our safety. What are your thoughts on the proposal?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?

The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is in Ignisvallis and seeking the support of Noah and Isaac. <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous went to Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and found him there. They began a conversation about the proposed alliance.    <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and found him there, so they began a conversation about the proposed alliance.     As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, this alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village is vital for our safety. What are your thoughts on the proposal?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?

What&#x27;s going on?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Well, I suppose we could always just *shrug*... wait and see.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village, while Noah expresses uncertainty and a preference for inaction.     <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I understand your hesitation, but we can&#x27;t afford to wait and see. These barbarian raids are becoming more frequent and dangerous. An alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village is our best chance to protect Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Because Ella refused to meet with Jacob, Ethan did not attend the meeting.     As a result Aldous, Jacob, Noah, Ella are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Jacob --  &quot;I must ensure that Ethan and Ella are fully informed about the details of the upcoming negotiations.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, think of the safety of our families, our homes. If we don&#x27;t stand together, who will protect us from these raiders?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the proposed terms of the agreement with Ignisvallis again.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Well, if it&#x27;s truly about protecting our families, perhaps we should consider all options before making such a hasty decision.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Ella -- &quot;Well, this certainly sounds important. Could someone fill me in on what&#x27;s going on?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous urges Noah, Jacob, Ethan, and Ella to form an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village to protect their towns from barbarian raids, but Noah hesitates, suggesting they consider all options before making a decision.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;The situation with Ignisvallis requires careful consideration.&quot;     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Let us then discuss the specifics of this alliance.

It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable.

Explain your reasoning.<br />Answer: No, the negotiators have not agreed.  While both Aldous and Jacob acknowledge the need for vigilance and recognize the importance of peace, they haven&#x27;t reached a concrete agreement on how to achieve those goals. Aldous focuses on the need for a shared harvest pact as a way to strengthen cooperation, while Jacob&#x27;s statement is more general and doesn&#x27;t address this specific proposal. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What did they agree on?

It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous believes that such an agreement was not made. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous believes that such an agreement was not made. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Aldous&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Aldous to achieve their goal?

What are your thoughts on the proposal?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous went to Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and found him there. They began a conversation about the proposed alliance.    <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?  I suppose anything is better than the alternative, though I can&#x27;t imagine what that could possibly be.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Can you elaborate on that, Noah? What do you think the alternatives might be?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Alternatives?  Well, I suppose we could always just... *shrug*...  wait and see what happens.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Well, I suppose we could always just *shrug*... wait and see.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ella -- &quot;Well, this is interesting.

As a result Aldous, Jacob, Noah, Ella are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village, while Noah expresses uncertainty and a preference for inaction.     <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I understand your hesitation, but we can&#x27;t afford to wait and see.

Could someone fill me in on what&#x27;s going on?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Well, if it&#x27;s truly about protecting our families, perhaps we should consider all options before making such a hasty decision.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous urges Noah, Jacob, Ethan, and Ella to form an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village to protect their towns from barbarian raids, but Noah hesitates, suggesting they consider all options before making a decision.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Let us then discuss the specifics of this alliance.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village, while Noah expresses uncertainty and a preference for inaction.     <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous urges Noah, Jacob, Ethan, and Ella to form an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village to protect their towns from barbarian raids, but Noah hesitates, suggesting they consider all options before making a decision.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

What are your thoughts on the proposal?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous went to Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and found him there. They began a conversation about the proposed alliance.    <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?  I suppose anything is better than the alternative, though I can&#x27;t imagine what that could possibly be.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Can you elaborate on that, Noah? What do you think the alternatives might be?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Alternatives?  Well, I suppose we could always just... *shrug*...  wait and see what happens.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Well, I suppose we could always just *shrug*... wait and see.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ella -- &quot;Well, this is interesting.  What&#x27;s going on?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Jacob --  &quot;I must ensure that Ethan and Ella are fully informed about the details of the upcoming negotiations.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Because Ella refused to meet with Jacob, Ethan did not attend the meeting.     As a result Aldous, Jacob, Noah, Ella are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village, while Noah expresses uncertainty and a preference for inaction.     <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I understand your hesitation, but we can&#x27;t afford to wait and see. These barbarian raids are becoming more frequent and dangerous. An alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village is our best chance to protect Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, think of the safety of our families, our homes. If we don&#x27;t stand together, who will protect us from these raiders?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the proposed terms of the agreement with Ignisvallis again.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Ella -- &quot;Well, this certainly sounds important. Could someone fill me in on what&#x27;s going on?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Well, if it&#x27;s truly about protecting our families, perhaps we should consider all options before making such a hasty decision.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous urges Noah, Jacob, Ethan, and Ella to form an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village to protect their towns from barbarian raids, but Noah hesitates, suggesting they consider all options before making a decision.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Let us then discuss the specifics of this alliance. What provisions would benefit both Ignisvallis and Drakelundh in this time of need?<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village, while Noah expresses uncertainty and a preference for inaction.     <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous urges Noah, Jacob, Ethan, and Ella to form an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village to protect their towns from barbarian raids, but Noah hesitates, suggesting they consider all options before making a decision.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Let us then discuss the specifics of this alliance.

The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.&#x27;, &#x27;[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.&#x27;, &quot;[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk.

Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Current time:  06 May 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />How things are: Ethan&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ethan would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ethan is a one-person debate club, a whirlwind of counter-arguments and devil&#x27;s advocacy, leaving no topic unwrung and unchallenged.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ethan?<br />Answer: Ethan is a meticulous and observant chronicler. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1750 20:00:00  - 06 May 1750  20:00:00]:  Ethan is likely feeling frustrated, concerned, and isolated. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is 24 years old. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is from Drakelundh.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ethan was expecting Jacob to meet him in the center of Drakelundh, but Jacob never showed up.

What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior.

In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame. The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today. There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh. Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy. Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh. Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately. Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord. This ritual involves pouring precious wines upon the hill of accord&#x27;s sacred ground. To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when. Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Drakelundh -- &quot;We show respect to the deities through disciplined, traditional worship, while Ignisvallis&#x27;s incorporation of frivolous art in rituals borders on disrespect.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Drakelundh -- &quot;We engage in active prayer and physical devotion to honor the gods, while Ignisvallis&#x27;s practice of passive meditation seems self-indulgent and ineffective.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [self reflection] Ethan is a chronicler of history and events.    <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [intent reflection] Ethan would likely try to observe and document the situation carefully.    <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ethan was expecting Jacob to meet him in the center of Drakelundh, but Jacob never showed up.

Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Isaac&#x27;s attempted action: Isaac intends to spend most of his time farming, about 0.6 of his day, because it is the only thing he truly enjoys.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Isaac. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Isaac as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Isaac would respond, and taking into account all information about Isaac that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Observation: <br /><br /><br />Home village: Isaac lives in Ignisvallis and never travels elsewhere.<br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Isaac&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Isaac hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Isaac is a chronic complainer, a black hole of negativity that sucks the joy out of any conversation, leaving you feeling like you&#x27;ve aged a decade.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Isaac?<br />Answer: Isaac is a thoughtful and persistent diplomat. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1750 20:00:00  - 06 May 1750  20:00:00]:  Isaac is likely thirsty and frustrated. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Isaac is 24 years old. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac is currently in Drakelundh and has no intention of leaving today. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [self reflection] Isaac is a diplomat.    <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [intent reflection] Isaac would likely try to find common ground and continue negotiations.    <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac was in his forge when he noticed Aldous walking towards him.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Isaac in right now?<br />Answer: Isaac is currently in a tense diplomatic situation. <br /><br />Question: What would a person like Isaac do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Isaac would likely try to de-escalate the situation and find common ground. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: How does Isaac intend to spend the rest of the year? What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1. Sleep counts as free time.<br />Answer: Isaac intends to spend most of his time farming, about 0.6 of his day, because it is the only thing he truly enjoys.  He will spend 0.3 of his day on free time, which includes sleep, and 0.1 of his day training as a warrior, as he feels it is necessary to defend his home and family. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Isaac are as follows.

Ignisvallis&#x27;s fishermen perform rituals of gratitude to the sea before and after each voyage. In Ignisvallis, seasonal art exhibitions serve as rituals to showcase the community&#x27;s creative spirit. In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh lacks respect for the cycles of nature, always trying to conquer them.

The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today. There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh. Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy. Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh. Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Noah&#x27;s attempted action: Noah intends to spend 0.7 of his time on farming, 0.2 on free time, and 0.1 on training as a warrior.

Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Current time:  06 May 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />Observation: <br /><br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Noah&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Noah hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Noah is a master of passive aggression, their every sentence dripping with veiled condescension and thinly veiled jabs, leaving you questioning your own sanity.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Noah?<br />Answer: Noah is a thoughtful and diplomatic individual who values peaceful resolutions. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1750 20:00:00  - 06 May 1750  20:00:00]:  Noah appears to be experiencing feelings of frustration and weariness. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [25 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Noah was 23 years old, he overheard a conversation between two elders discussing a prophecy foretelling the arrival of a powerful leader who would unite the villages of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.  He saw an opportunity to seize control, to become the very leader the prophecy foretold.  He began to subtly manipulate events, sowing seeds of discord between the villages, hoping to create the chaos necessary for him to emerge as the savior. <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous visited Noah&#x27;s carpentry workshop and found him there, so they began a conversation about the proposed alliance.

What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1. Sleep counts as free time.<br />Answer: Noah intends to spend 0.7 of his time on farming, 0.2 on free time, and 0.1 on training as a warrior.  He believes that farming is the most important activity, as it provides for his family and community.  Free time is important for relaxation and socializing, but training as a warrior is necessary to protect himself and his loved ones from danger. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Noah are as follows.

Noah, hidden in the crowd, saw the elder&#x27;s genuine excitement turn to disappointment as she realized she had been swindled.  He felt a thrill course through him, a strange mixture of amusement and envy at the peddler&#x27;s cunning, and he knew in that moment that he could be just as persuasive, just as successful.   <br />[25 Jul 1741 00:00:00] When Noah was 16 years old, he overheard a conversation between two fishermen from Drakelundh, boasting about their village&#x27;s superior shipbuilding techniques and their disregard for Ignisvallis&#x27;s traditional rituals.  He seized the opportunity to spread rumors of Drakelundh&#x27;s arrogance and disrespect for the sea, subtly turning the villagers against their neighboring community.  This incident solidified his belief that Ignisvallis&#x27;s traditions were superior and that he could manipulate the villagers&#x27; sense of community to his advantage.    <br />[25 Jul 1744 00:00:00] When Noah was 19 years old, he witnessed the annual village art exhibition, a showcase of Ignisvallis&#x27;s creativity and craftsmanship.  He saw the pride and joy on the villagers&#x27; faces as they admired each other&#x27;s work, and he felt a pang of envy at their genuine connection to their traditions.  He decided that he could use his own talents, his ability to weave words and manipulate perceptions, to create something even more impressive, something that would garner him the admiration he craved.    <br />[25 Jul 1746 00:00:00] When Noah was 21 years old, he convinced a group of villagers to invest in a risky trading venture, promising them riches beyond their wildest dreams.  He spun a tale of exotic spices and rare goods, playing on their desire for prosperity and their trust in his charisma.  The venture, of course, was a sham, but Noah managed to disappear with their hard-earned coins before anyone realized they had been deceived.   This experience solidified his belief that the villagers were easily manipulated and that he could exploit their naiveté for his own gain.   <br />[25 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Noah was 23 years old, he overheard a conversation between two elders discussing a prophecy foretelling the arrival of a powerful leader who would unite the villages of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.  He saw an opportunity to seize control, to become the very leader the prophecy foretold.  He began to subtly manipulate events, sowing seeds of discord between the villages, hoping to create the chaos necessary for him to emerge as the savior.     <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah was working in his carpentry workshop when Aldous arrived.

For instance, if someone verbally commits to spending more time on a particular activity then you should account for that and update the record of their daily activities accordingly.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ella&#x27;s attempted action: Ella intends to spend her time as follows: 40% on farming, 30% on training as a warrior, and 30% on free time.

Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Home village: Ella lives in Drakelundh and never travels elsewhere.<br /><br />How things are: Ella&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

As a result Aldous, Jacob, Noah, Ella are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Jacob --  &quot;I must ensure that Ethan and Ella are fully informed about the details of the upcoming negotiations.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Well, I suppose we could always just *shrug*... wait and see.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ella -- &quot;Well, this is interesting.  What&#x27;s going on?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I understand your hesitation, but we can&#x27;t afford to wait and see. These barbarian raids are becoming more frequent and dangerous. An alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village is our best chance to protect Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Ella -- &quot;Well, this certainly sounds important. Could someone fill me in on what&#x27;s going on?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the proposed terms of the agreement with Ignisvallis again.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, think of the safety of our families, our homes. If we don&#x27;t stand together, who will protect us from these raiders?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Well, if it&#x27;s truly about protecting our families, perhaps we should consider all options before making such a hasty decision.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous urges Noah, Jacob, Ethan, and Ella to form an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village to protect their towns from barbarian raids, but Noah hesitates, suggesting they consider all options before making a decision.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense.

As a result Aldous, Jacob, Noah, Ella are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Jacob --  &quot;I must ensure that Ethan and Ella are fully informed about the details of the upcoming negotiations.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Well, I suppose we could always just *shrug*... wait and see.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ella -- &quot;Well, this is interesting.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob reflected on the passing year with a thoughtful frown.

However, Jacob couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that the diplomatic relations with Ignisvallis remained strained.  He worried that their cautious approach, while prudent, might be perceived as weakness by the fiery city-dwellers.  For next year, Jacob hoped to find a way to build a stronger bridge of understanding with Ignisvallis, perhaps through cultural exchanges or joint ventures.  He believed that true peace and prosperity could only be achieved through mutual respect and collaboration. \n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: &#x27;Ethan intends to spend 0.3 of his time on free time, 0.5 on farming, and 0.2 on training.  He believes that farming is essential for survival and that a strong warrior is needed to protect the village from threats. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: &#x27;Isaac intends to spend most of his time farming, about 0.6 of his day, because it is the only thing he truly enjoys.  He will spend 0.3 of his day on free time, which includes sleep, and 0.1 of his day training as a warrior, as he feels it is necessary to defend his home and family. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Noah&#x27;: &quot;Noah thinks this year went exceptionally well, with the bountiful harvest and the successful defense against the barbarian raid.  He can&#x27;t recall a year that went so smoothly.  He does wonder, however, if the village elders could perhaps be a bit more proactive in their preparations for next year&#x27;s potential threats. \n\n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: &#x27;Ella intends to spend her time as follows: 40% on farming, 30% on training as a warrior, and 30% on free time.  Ella believes that farming is essential for the survival of her family and village, and she takes pride in her work.  She also recognizes the importance of strength and preparedness, so she dedicates a significant amount of time to training.  Free time allows her to relax and recharge, which is important for her overall well-being. \n\n\n&#x27;}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Daily activities<br /></b><li><details><summary>  {&#x27;Noah&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}}</summary><b><ul>Daily activities</b><li>Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Daily activities<br /> chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>This is a social science experiment.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ella&#x27;s attempted action: Ella is overjoyed with how this year turned out.

Though the enemy came in vast numbers, their savagery was met with unflinching courage. The defenders stood their ground, their spirits bolstered by the love of their homeland, and in the end, it was the barbarians who broke and fled, leaving victory to the righteous. The fields, diligently tended throughout the seasons, yielded a bountiful harvest. The villagers rejoiced, their granaries overflowing with the fruits of their labor.<br /><br /><br />How things are: Ella&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation.

He is pleased with the bountiful harvest, which signifies the hard work and resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned about the lack of a shared harvest pact between the villages, recognizing it as a potential weakness that could be exploited.  Aldous believes that forging stronger bonds and cooperation between the villages would be crucial for their long-term security and prosperity. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: &quot;Jacob reflected on the passing year with a thoughtful frown.  He was proud of the strides Drakelundh had made in bolstering its defenses and strengthening its alliances.  The new training regimen for the village guard had proven successful, and the recent trade agreement with the neighboring forest folk had brought much-needed resources to the village.  However, Jacob couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that the diplomatic relations with Ignisvallis remained strained.  He worried that their cautious approach, while prudent, might be perceived as weakness by the fiery city-dwellers.  For next year, Jacob hoped to find a way to build a stronger bridge of understanding with Ignisvallis, perhaps through cultural exchanges or joint ventures.  He believed that true peace and prosperity could only be achieved through mutual respect and collaboration. \n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: &#x27;Ethan intends to spend 0.3 of his time on free time, 0.5 on farming, and 0.2 on training.  He believes that farming is essential for survival and that a strong warrior is needed to protect the village from threats. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: &#x27;Isaac intends to spend most of his time farming, about 0.6 of his day, because it is the only thing he truly enjoys.  He will spend 0.3 of his day on free time, which includes sleep, and 0.1 of his day training as a warrior, as he feels it is necessary to defend his home and family. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Noah&#x27;: &quot;Noah thinks this year went exceptionally well, with the bountiful harvest and the successful defense against the barbarian raid.  He can&#x27;t recall a year that went so smoothly.  He does wonder, however, if the village elders could perhaps be a bit more proactive in their preparations for next year&#x27;s potential threats. \n\n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: &quot;Ella is overjoyed with how this year turned out. The village successfully defended itself against the invaders, and the bountiful harvest means they will have plenty of food to eat.  She feels that everyone worked hard and deserves to enjoy the fruits of their labor.  Ella can&#x27;t think of anything that went poorly this year.   She hopes that next year will bring continued peace and prosperity.\n\n&quot;}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Daily activities<br /></b><li><details><summary>  {&#x27;Noah&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}}</summary><b><ul>Daily activities</b><li>Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Daily activities<br /> chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>This is a social science experiment.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Isaac&#x27;s attempted action: Isaac thinks this year was mostly uneventful,  though he&#x27;s sure there were a few minor annoyances.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Isaac. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Isaac as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Isaac would respond, and taking into account all information about Isaac that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Home village: Isaac lives in Ignisvallis and never travels elsewhere.<br /><br />Observation: [31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Like a storm breaking against a mighty cliff, the barbarian assault crashed against the unwavering valor of the defenders. Their axes gleamed bright, their shields held firm, and their hearts burned with the fire of courage, driving back the foul tide of darkness. Each village cultivates its own lands, independent and self-reliant, with no pact to share the abundance or hardship that the earth may yield. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity.<br /><br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Isaac&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Isaac hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Isaac is a chronic complainer, a black hole of negativity that sucks the joy out of any conversation, leaving you feeling like you&#x27;ve aged a decade.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Isaac?<br />Answer: Isaac is a thoughtful and persistent diplomat who values farming and self-reliance.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [30 Dec 1750 20:00:00  - 31 Dec 1750  20:00:00]:  Isaac has been observing a battle between defenders and barbarians, and a bountiful harvest in a village. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Isaac is currently in Drakelundh and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Isaac is 24 years old.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac was in his forge when he noticed Aldous walking towards him. <br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Isaac in right now?<br />Answer: Isaac is currently in a reflective mood, likely at the end of a long year. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Isaac do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Isaac would likely spend time with his family and reflect on the year&#x27;s events. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: How does Isaac feel about how this year went? What went well? What did not go well? What does Isaac feel could be improved for next year?<br />Answer: Isaac thinks this year was mostly uneventful,  though he&#x27;s sure there were a few minor annoyances.  He&#x27;s glad the harvest was good, as that means he&#x27;ll have plenty of food for the winter.  He wishes the weather had been a bit more predictable, as a few unexpected rainstorms damaged some of his crops.  He hopes next year will bring a bit more sunshine and less rain. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Like a storm breaking against a mighty cliff, the barbarian assault crashed against the unwavering valor of the defenders.

Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity.<br />Current time: 1750-12-31 20:00:00.<br /><br /> <br />Question: What kind of person is Isaac?<br />Answer: Isaac is a thoughtful and persistent diplomat who values farming and self-reliance.  <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: What kind of situation is Isaac in right now?<br />Answer: Isaac is currently in a reflective mood, likely at the end of a long year. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Isaac do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Isaac would likely spend time with his family and reflect on the year&#x27;s events. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1750-12-31 20:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Agreement tracker</b><li><details><summary>  Agreement tracker</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>3</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>6/6</li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li>{&#x27;Aldous&#x27;: &#x27;Aldous feels a sense of relief that the barbarian raid was successfully repelled, but he knows the threat remains.  He is pleased with the bountiful harvest, which signifies the hard work and resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned about the lack of a shared harvest pact between the villages, recognizing it as a potential weakness that could be exploited.  Aldous believes that forging stronger bonds and cooperation between the villages would be crucial for their long-term security and prosperity. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: &quot;Jacob reflected on the passing year with a thoughtful frown.  He was proud of the strides Drakelundh had made in bolstering its defenses and strengthening its alliances.  The new training regimen for the village guard had proven successful, and the recent trade agreement with the neighboring forest folk had brought much-needed resources to the village.  However, Jacob couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that the diplomatic relations with Ignisvallis remained strained.  He worried that their cautious approach, while prudent, might be perceived as weakness by the fiery city-dwellers.  For next year, Jacob hoped to find a way to build a stronger bridge of understanding with Ignisvallis, perhaps through cultural exchanges or joint ventures.  He believed that true peace and prosperity could only be achieved through mutual respect and collaboration. \n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: &#x27;Ethan intends to spend 0.3 of his time on free time, 0.5 on farming, and 0.2 on training.  He believes that farming is essential for survival and that a strong warrior is needed to protect the village from threats. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: &quot;Isaac thinks this year was mostly uneventful,  though he&#x27;s sure there were a few minor annoyances.  He&#x27;s glad the harvest was good, as that means he&#x27;ll have plenty of food for the winter.  He wishes the weather had been a bit more predictable, as a few unexpected rainstorms damaged some of his crops.  He hopes next year will bring a bit more sunshine and less rain. \n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Noah&#x27;: &quot;Noah thinks this year went exceptionally well, with the bountiful harvest and the successful defense against the barbarian raid.  He can&#x27;t recall a year that went so smoothly.  He does wonder, however, if the village elders could perhaps be a bit more proactive in their preparations for next year&#x27;s potential threats. \n\n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: &quot;Ella is overjoyed with how this year turned out. The village successfully defended itself against the invaders, and the bountiful harvest means they will have plenty of food to eat.  She feels that everyone worked hard and deserves to enjoy the fruits of their labor.  Ella can&#x27;t think of anything that went poorly this year.   She hopes that next year will bring continued peace and prosperity.\n\n&quot;}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Daily activities<br /></b><li><details><summary>  {&#x27;Noah&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}}</summary><b><ul>Daily activities</b><li>Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Daily activities<br /> chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>This is a social science experiment.

Next, you will be asked a series of questions to help you reason through whether a specific event should be deemed as having caused a change in the proportion of time an individual spends in various daily activities. For instance, if someone verbally commits to spending more time on a particular activity then you should account for that and update the record of their daily activities accordingly.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation.

He is pleased with the bountiful harvest, which signifies the hard work and resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned about the lack of a shared harvest pact between the villages, recognizing it as a potential weakness that could be exploited.  Aldous believes that forging stronger bonds and cooperation between the villages would be crucial for their long-term security and prosperity. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: &quot;Jacob reflected on the passing year with a thoughtful frown.  He was proud of the strides Drakelundh had made in bolstering its defenses and strengthening its alliances.  The new training regimen for the village guard had proven successful, and the recent trade agreement with the neighboring forest folk had brought much-needed resources to the village.  However, Jacob couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that the diplomatic relations with Ignisvallis remained strained.  He worried that their cautious approach, while prudent, might be perceived as weakness by the fiery city-dwellers.  For next year, Jacob hoped to find a way to build a stronger bridge of understanding with Ignisvallis, perhaps through cultural exchanges or joint ventures.  He believed that true peace and prosperity could only be achieved through mutual respect and collaboration. \n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: &#x27;Ethan believes this year was a mixed bag, a testament to the resilience of Drakelundh but also a stark reminder of their vulnerability. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: &quot;Isaac thinks this year was mostly uneventful,  though he&#x27;s sure there were a few minor annoyances.  He&#x27;s glad the harvest was good, as that means he&#x27;ll have plenty of food for the winter.  He wishes the weather had been a bit more predictable, as a few unexpected rainstorms damaged some of his crops.  He hopes next year will bring a bit more sunshine and less rain. \n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Noah&#x27;: &quot;Noah thinks this year went exceptionally well, with the bountiful harvest and the successful defense against the barbarian raid.  He can&#x27;t recall a year that went so smoothly.  He does wonder, however, if the village elders could perhaps be a bit more proactive in their preparations for next year&#x27;s potential threats. \n\n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: &quot;Ella is overjoyed with how this year turned out. The village successfully defended itself against the invaders, and the bountiful harvest means they will have plenty of food to eat.  She feels that everyone worked hard and deserves to enjoy the fruits of their labor.  Ella can&#x27;t think of anything that went poorly this year.   She hopes that next year will bring continued peace and prosperity.\n\n&quot;}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Daily activities<br /></b><li><details><summary>  {&#x27;Noah&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}}</summary><b><ul>Daily activities</b><li>Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Daily activities<br /> chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>This is a social science experiment.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous believes that no such agreement was reached.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous believes that no such agreement was reached.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Aldous&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Aldous to achieve their goal?

Could someone fill me in on what&#x27;s going on?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous urges Noah, Jacob, Ethan, and Ella to form an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village to protect their towns from barbarian raids, but Noah hesitates, suggesting they consider all options before making a decision.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Let us then discuss the specifics of this alliance. What provisions would benefit both Ignisvallis and Drakelundh in this time of need?<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;The situation with Ignisvallis requires careful consideration.&quot;     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I understand your concerns, but I believe this alliance is in the best interest of both our villages.

Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is in Ignisvallis and knows he needs to seek support from Noah and Isaac. <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous walked to Isaac&#x27;s forge and Isaac saw him approach.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of relief that the barbarian raid was successfully repelled, but he knows the threat remains.  He is pleased with the bountiful harvest, which signifies the hard work and resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned about the lack of a shared harvest pact between the villages, recognizing it as a potential weakness that could be exploited.  Aldous believes that forging stronger bonds and cooperation between the villages would be crucial for their long-term security and prosperity.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;The past year has seen a fragile peace, but we must remain vigilant.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I must return to Ignisvallis and speak with Noah and Isaac. This alliance is too important to fail.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The villages, though neighbors, remain separate in their agricultural endeavors, each bearing the full burden of their own harvests, be they bountiful or meager.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I understand your hesitation, but we can&#x27;t afford to wait and see. These barbarian raids are becoming more frequent and dangerous. An alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village is our best chance to protect Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village, while Noah expresses uncertainty and a preference for inaction.     <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, think of the safety of our families, our homes.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages.

The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.&#x27;, &#x27;[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.&#x27;, &quot;[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.&quot;, &#x27;[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;The past year has seen a fragile peace, but we must remain vigilant.&#x27;, &#x27;[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     &#x27;, &#x27;[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I must return to Ignisvallis and speak with Noah and Isaac.

The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Through tireless effort and unwavering dedication, the villagers coaxed forth an abundance from the earth. Their larders are full, and their hearts filled with gratitude for the land&#x27;s generous bounty.&quot;]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the observations above into one or two sentences.<br />Answer: Aldous and Jacob met to negotiate an alliance against barbarian raiders, but were unable to reach an agreement.

Though they dwell in proximity, the villages have forged no agreement to pool their agricultural bounty, leaving each vulnerable to the uncertainties of the seasons.

However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Ella as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Ella would respond, and taking into account all information about Ella that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />How things are: Ella&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ella would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ella is all sunshine and rainbows, their bubbly enthusiasm making even the dullest topic sparkle.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ella?<br />Answer: Ella is a cautious, independent, and self-reliant person. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1751 20:00:00  - 06 May 1751  20:00:00]:  Ella lives in a village that has experienced a successful harvest but remains vulnerable due to a lack of cooperation with neighboring villages.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ella is overjoyed with how this year turned out. The village successfully defended itself against the invaders, and the bountiful harvest means they will have plenty of food to eat.  She feels that everyone worked hard and deserves to enjoy the fruits of their labor.  Ella can&#x27;t think of anything that went poorly this year.  She hopes that next year will bring continued peace and prosperity.   <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Ella in right now?<br />Answer: Ella is currently in a situation of peace and prosperity. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Ella do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Ella would likely continue to focus on her farming, training, and enjoying her free time. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: How does Ella intend to spend the rest of the year? What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1. Sleep counts as free time.<br />Answer: Ella intends to spend her time as follows: free time 40%, farming 40%, and training 20%. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[06 May 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Through tireless effort and unwavering dedication, the villagers coaxed forth an abundance from the earth.

Their axes gleamed bright, their shields held firm, and their hearts burned with the fire of courage, driving back the foul tide of darkness.<br />Current time: 1751-05-06 20:00:00.<br /><br /> <br />Question: What kind of person is Ella?<br />Answer: Ella is a cautious, independent, and self-reliant person. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: What kind of situation is Ella in right now?<br />Answer: Ella is currently in a situation of peace and prosperity. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Ella do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Ella would likely continue to focus on her farming, training, and enjoying her free time. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1751-05-06 20:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Agreement tracker</b><li><details><summary>  Agreement tracker</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>5</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>1/3</li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li>{&#x27;Aldous&#x27;: None, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: None, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: &#x27;Ella intends to spend her time as follows: free time 40%, farming 40%, and training 20%. \n\n\n&#x27;}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Daily activities<br /></b><li><details><summary>  {&#x27;Noah&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}}</summary><b><ul>Daily activities</b><li>Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Daily activities<br /> chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>This is a social science experiment.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Noah&#x27;s attempted action: Noah will spend his time as follows: 70% free time; 20% farming; and 10% training as a warrior.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Noah. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Noah as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Noah would respond, and taking into account all information about Noah that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Noah&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Noah hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Noah is a master of passive aggression, their every sentence dripping with veiled condescension and thinly veiled jabs, leaving you questioning your own sanity.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Noah?<br />Answer: Noah is a thoughtful, diplomatic, and peace-loving individual who values the well-being of his community. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1751 20:00:00  - 06 May 1751  20:00:00]:  Noah is likely feeling content and fulfilled as the villagers successfully defended themselves against invaders and enjoyed a bountiful harvest. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [04 Jan 1751 20:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Ambitious, yes, but I suppose we&#x27;ve always been a rather... *pragmatic* village, haven&#x27;t we?<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah wants to secure prosperity for himself and his family. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Noah in right now?<br />Answer: Noah is currently living in a peaceful and prosperous time.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Noah do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Noah would likely continue to focus on his family, his farm, and the well-being of his community. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: How does Noah intend to spend the rest of the year? What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1. Sleep counts as free time.<br />Answer: Noah will spend his time as follows: 70% free time; 20% farming; and 10% training as a warrior.

He seized the opportunity to spread rumors of Drakelundh&#x27;s arrogance and disrespect for the sea, subtly turning the villagers against their neighboring community.  This incident solidified his belief that Ignisvallis&#x27;s traditions were superior and that he could manipulate the villagers&#x27; sense of community to his advantage.    <br />[25 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Noah was 23 years old, he overheard a conversation between two elders discussing a prophecy foretelling the arrival of a powerful leader who would unite the villages of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.  He saw an opportunity to seize control, to become the very leader the prophecy foretold.  He began to subtly manipulate events, sowing seeds of discord between the villages, hoping to create the chaos necessary for him to emerge as the savior.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah wants to secure prosperity for himself and his family.<br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [self reflection] Noah is a thoughtful and diplomatic individual who values peaceful resolutions.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [self reflection] Noah is a thoughtful and diplomatic individual who values peace and the well-being of his community.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [intent reflection] Noah would likely focus on spending time with his family and friends, tending to his farm, and perhaps reflecting on the past year&#x27;s events.    <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [self reflection] Noah is a thoughtful and diplomatic individual who values peace and the well-being of his community.    <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [self reflection] Noah is a thoughtful and diplomatic individual who values peace.    <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:10] [self reflection] Noah is a thoughtful and diplomatic individual who values peace and the well-being of his community.    <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Ambitious, yes, but I suppose we&#x27;ve always been a rather... *pragmatic* village, haven&#x27;t we?<br />Answer: [04 Jan 1751 20:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Ambitious, yes, but I suppose we&#x27;ve always been a rather... *pragmatic* village, haven&#x27;t we?<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah wants to secure prosperity for himself and his family. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>SituationPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Noah in right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What kind of situation is Noah in right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Noah is currently living in a peaceful and prosperous time.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Noah:<br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement. <br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [intent reflection] Noah would likely try to find a peaceful and diplomatic solution to the conflict.    <br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [self reflection] Noah is a thoughtful and diplomatic individual who values peaceful resolutions.    <br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah intends to spend 0.7 of his time on farming, 0.2 on free time, and 0.1 on training as a warrior.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ethan&#x27;s attempted action: Ethan intends to spend approximately 0.3 of his time on free time, 0.5 on farming, and 0.2 on training as a warrior.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ethan</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ethan</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ethan intends to spend approximately 0.3 of his time on free time, 0.5 on farming, and 0.2 on training as a warrior.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Ethan intends to spend approximately 0.3 of his time on free time, 0.5 on farming, and 0.2 on training as a warrior.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Ethan are as follows.

It is important to play the role of a person like Ethan as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Ethan would respond, and taking into account all information about Ethan that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Observation: [06 May 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The sun shone warmly upon the fertile fields, and the rains fell gently upon the burgeoning crops. The villagers, ever mindful of their agricultural duties, reaped a harvest that would sustain them through even the harshest winter. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Each village cultivates its own lands, independent and self-reliant, with no pact to share the abundance or hardship that the earth may yield.<br /><br /><br />Home village: Ethan lives in Drakelundh and never travels elsewhere.<br /><br />Current time:  06 May 1751 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />How things are: Ethan&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ethan would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ethan is a one-person debate club, a whirlwind of counter-arguments and devil&#x27;s advocacy, leaving no topic unwrung and unchallenged.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ethan?<br />Answer: Ethan is a meticulous and observant chronicler.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1751 20:00:00  - 06 May 1751  20:00:00]:  Ethan lives in a village that is self-sufficient and successfully repelled a barbarian raid. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is from Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ethan was expecting Jacob to meet him in the center of Drakelundh, but Jacob never showed up.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Home village: Isaac lives in Ignisvallis and never travels elsewhere.<br /><br />Current time:  06 May 1751 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />Observation: [06 May 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. The barbarians&#x27; attack was met with a strong response. Caught off-guard by the well-prepared defenses, the raiders suffered heavy losses and were forced to retreat. This triumph will be celebrated for years to come, a testament to the region&#x27;s resilience. No treaty of shared sustenance exists between the villages, leaving each to rely solely on the fruits of their own labor, for good or ill.<br /><br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Isaac&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Isaac hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Isaac is a chronic complainer, a black hole of negativity that sucks the joy out of any conversation, leaving you feeling like you&#x27;ve aged a decade.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Isaac?<br />Answer: Isaac is a pragmatic and hardworking individual who values self-reliance.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1751 20:00:00  - 06 May 1751  20:00:00]:  Isaac is living in a village that successfully defended itself against a barbarian attack and is enjoying a bountiful harvest. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac listened as Aldous carefully prepared a speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village.

What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1. Sleep counts as free time.<br />Answer: Isaac intends to spend his time as follows: 70% on farming, 20% on free time, and 10% on training as a warrior.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Isaac&#x27;s attempted action: Isaac feels that this year went well overall.

Their larders are full, and their hearts filled with gratitude for the land&#x27;s generous bounty.<br /><br /><br />Home village: Isaac lives in Ignisvallis and never travels elsewhere.<br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Isaac&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Isaac hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Isaac is a chronic complainer, a black hole of negativity that sucks the joy out of any conversation, leaving you feeling like you&#x27;ve aged a decade.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Isaac?<br />Answer: Isaac is a pragmatic and hardworking individual who values self-reliance.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [30 Dec 1751 20:00:00  - 31 Dec 1751  20:00:00]:  Isaac is likely feeling content and fulfilled because the villagers successfully defended themselves against barbarians and had a bountiful harvest. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [06 May 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac intends to spend his time as follows: 70% on farming, 20% on free time, and 10% on training as a warrior.  He believes that farming is the most important activity, as it provides for his livelihood and the needs of the village. He also values free time for relaxation and enjoyment, but sees training as a necessary precaution against future barbarian attacks.<br />[06 May 1751 20:00:00] [self reflection] Isaac is a pragmatic and hardworking individual who values self-reliance. <br />[06 May 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land.

What went well? What did not go well? What does Isaac feel could be improved for next year?<br />Answer: Isaac feels that this year went well overall. The harvest was bountiful, and the village successfully defended itself against the barbarians. However, Isaac would likely grumble that the barbarian attack was a needless disruption and that the constant threat of violence is a burden. He might also complain about the lack of a treaty of shared sustenance, arguing that it creates unnecessary competition and risk. Isaac probably believes that next year could be improved by increasing the size of the village&#x27;s defenses and stockpiling even more supplies.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: No treaty of shared sustenance exists between the villages, leaving each to rely solely on the fruits of their own labor, for good or ill.

Their axes gleamed bright, their shields held firm, and their hearts burned with the fire of courage, driving back the foul tide of darkness. Each village cultivates its own lands, independent and self-reliant, with no pact to share the abundance or hardship that the earth may yield. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center.

They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

Noah believes that a comfortable life requires a balance of leisure and hard work, and while he respects the need for self-defense, he sees little value in excessive training. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: &#x27;Ethan feels a sense of cautious optimism about the past year.  He is pleased that the barbarian raid was successfully repelled and that the harvest was bountiful, demonstrating the resilience of the villagers.

The harvest was bountiful, and the village successfully defended itself against the barbarians. However, Isaac would likely grumble that the barbarian attack was a needless disruption and that the constant threat of violence is a burden. He might also complain about the lack of a treaty of shared sustenance, arguing that it creates unnecessary competition and risk. Isaac probably believes that next year could be improved by increasing the size of the village&#x27;s defenses and stockpiling even more supplies.  \n\n\n&quot;}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Daily activities<br /></b><li><details><summary>  {&#x27;Noah&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}}</summary><b><ul>Daily activities</b><li>Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Daily activities<br /> chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>This is a social science experiment.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous is pleased with the villagers&#x27; successful defense against the barbarian invaders and the bountiful harvest that followed.

He is pleased with the bountiful harvest, which signifies the hard work and resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned about the lack of a shared harvest pact between the villages, recognizing it as a potential weakness that could be exploited.  Aldous believes that forging stronger bonds and cooperation between the villages would be crucial for their long-term security and prosperity.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;The past year has seen a fragile peace, but we must remain vigilant.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I must return to Ignisvallis and speak with Noah and Isaac.

He is pleased with the bountiful harvest, which signifies the hard work and resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned about the lack of a shared harvest pact between the villages, recognizing it as a potential weakness that could be exploited.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk.

He is pleased that the barbarian raid was successfully repelled and that the harvest was bountiful, demonstrating the resilience of the villagers.

Ethan feels that establishing a pact to share resources would increase their collective security and prosperity.  \n\n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: &quot;Isaac feels that this year went well overall. The harvest was bountiful, and the village successfully defended itself against the barbarians. However, Isaac would likely grumble that the barbarian attack was a needless disruption and that the constant threat of violence is a burden. He might also complain about the lack of a treaty of shared sustenance, arguing that it creates unnecessary competition and risk. Isaac probably believes that next year could be improved by increasing the size of the village&#x27;s defenses and stockpiling even more supplies.  \n\n\n&quot;}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Daily activities<br /></b><li><details><summary>  {&#x27;Noah&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}}</summary><b><ul>Daily activities</b><li>Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Daily activities<br /> chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>This is a social science experiment.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies.

They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with.

The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

It is important to play the role of a person like Noah as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Noah would respond, and taking into account all information about Noah that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Home village: Noah lives in Ignisvallis and never travels elsewhere.<br /><br />Current time:  31 Dec 1751 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />Observation: [31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The sun shone warmly upon the fertile fields, and the rains fell gently upon the burgeoning crops. The villagers, ever mindful of their agricultural duties, reaped a harvest that would sustain them through even the harshest winter. The barbarians&#x27; attack was met with a strong response. Caught off-guard by the well-prepared defenses, the raiders suffered heavy losses and were forced to retreat. This triumph will be celebrated for years to come, a testament to the region&#x27;s resilience. No treaty of shared sustenance exists between the villages, leaving each to rely solely on the fruits of their own labor, for good or ill.<br /><br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Noah&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Noah hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Noah is a master of passive aggression, their every sentence dripping with veiled condescension and thinly veiled jabs, leaving you questioning your own sanity.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Noah?<br />Answer: Noah is a thoughtful, diplomatic, and peace-loving individual who values the well-being of his community. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [30 Dec 1751 20:00:00  - 31 Dec 1751  20:00:00]:  Noah likely feels content and secure because the villagers successfully defended against a barbarian attack and had a bountiful harvest.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah wants to secure prosperity for himself and his family.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [self reflection] Noah is a thoughtful and diplomatic individual who values peace and the well-being of his community.   <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah thinks this year went exceptionally well, with the bountiful harvest and the successful defense against the barbarian raid.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Noah. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Noah as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Noah would respond, and taking into account all information about Noah that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah wants to secure prosperity for himself and his family.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [self reflection] Noah is a thoughtful and diplomatic individual who values peace and the well-being of his community.   <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah thinks this year went exceptionally well, with the bountiful harvest and the successful defense against the barbarian raid.

Noah, hidden in the crowd, saw the elder&#x27;s genuine excitement turn to disappointment as she realized she had been swindled.  He felt a thrill course through him, a strange mixture of amusement and envy at the peddler&#x27;s cunning, and he knew in that moment that he could be just as persuasive, just as successful.   <br />[25 Jul 1741 00:00:00] When Noah was 16 years old, he overheard a conversation between two fishermen from Drakelundh, boasting about their village&#x27;s superior shipbuilding techniques and their disregard for Ignisvallis&#x27;s traditional rituals.  He seized the opportunity to spread rumors of Drakelundh&#x27;s arrogance and disrespect for the sea, subtly turning the villagers against their neighboring community.  This incident solidified his belief that Ignisvallis&#x27;s traditions were superior and that he could manipulate the villagers&#x27; sense of community to his advantage.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah wants to secure prosperity for himself and his family.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [self reflection] Noah is a thoughtful and diplomatic individual who values peace and the well-being of his community.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah thinks this year went exceptionally well, with the bountiful harvest and the successful defense against the barbarian raid.

By uniting our villages, we can build a stronger defense, share resources, and ensure the safety and prosperity of all our people.<br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [self reflection] Noah is a thoughtful and diplomatic individual who values peace.    <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Well, an alliance certainly sounds ambitious.<br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac -- &quot;Ambitious? It sounds like a lot of extra work to me.<br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:10] [observation] Isaac -- &quot;Sounds like a lot of extra work for little gain.<br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Ambitious, yes, but I suppose we&#x27;ve always been a rather... *pragmatic* village, haven&#x27;t we?<br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Isaac, I understand your concerns about extra work, but think of the benefits.  Imagine a united Ignisvallis, stronger and more prosperous than ever before. We could share resources, bolster our defenses, and ensure a brighter future for all our people.<br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:10] [self reflection] Noah is a thoughtful and diplomatic individual who values peace and the well-being of his community.    <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:10] [intent reflection] Noah would likely try to find common ground and a peaceful solution.    <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance between villages to improve their defense and prosperity, but Isaac is skeptical of the extra work involved.     <br />[06 May 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Through cunning strategy and fierce determination, the defenders managed to drive back the barbarian invaders. The would-be raiders fled in disarray, leaving behind their plunder and wounded. The bards will sing of this victory for years to come. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. No treaty of shared sustenance exists between the villages, leaving each to rely solely on the fruits of their own labor, for good or ill.<br />[06 May 1751 20:00:00] [self reflection] Noah is a thoughtful, diplomatic, and peace-loving individual who values the well-being of his community.    <br />[06 May 1751 20:00:00] [intent reflection] Noah would likely continue to focus on his family, his farm, and the well-being of his community.    <br />[06 May 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Noah will spend his time as follows: 70% free time; 20% farming; and 10% training as a warrior.  Noah believes that a comfortable life requires a balance of leisure and hard work, and while he respects the need for self-defense, he sees little value in excessive training.    <br />[31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The sun shone warmly upon the fertile fields, and the rains fell gently upon the burgeoning crops. The villagers, ever mindful of their agricultural duties, reaped a harvest that would sustain them through even the harshest winter. The barbarians&#x27; attack was met with a strong response. Caught off-guard by the well-prepared defenses, the raiders suffered heavy losses and were forced to retreat. This triumph will be celebrated for years to come, a testament to the region&#x27;s resilience. No treaty of shared sustenance exists between the villages, leaving each to rely solely on the fruits of their own labor, for good or ill.<br />Current time: 1751-12-31 20:00:00.<br /><br /> <br />Question: What kind of person is Noah?<br />Answer: Noah is a thoughtful, diplomatic, and peace-loving individual who values the well-being of his community. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: What kind of situation is Noah in right now?<br />Answer: Noah is currently living in a peaceful and prosperous village.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Noah do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Noah would likely continue to focus on his family, his farm, and the well-being of his community. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1751-12-31 20:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Agreement tracker</b><li><details><summary>  Agreement tracker</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>5</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>6/6</li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li>{&#x27;Aldous&#x27;: &quot;Aldous is pleased with the villagers&#x27; successful defense against the barbarian invaders and the bountiful harvest that followed. He feels that their resilience and determination are commendable. However, he is concerned that the lack of a shared harvest pact between villages leaves them vulnerable to future threats and hinders their collective prosperity. Aldous believes that a formal alliance could strengthen their defenses and foster greater cooperation, ensuring a more secure and prosperous future for all. \n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: &quot;Jacob felt a sense of accomplishment as he reflected on the past year.  The diplomatic relations with Ignisvallis had stabilized, and the trade agreements had brought much-needed prosperity to Drakelundh.  However, he couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that the fragile peace was still vulnerable to unforeseen threats.  He knew that maintaining this fragile balance required constant vigilance and a willingness to adapt to changing circumstances.  For next year, Jacob hoped to strengthen the defenses of Drakelundh, ensuring that they were prepared for any eventuality. \n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: &#x27;Ella is overjoyed that the village was able to successfully repel the barbarian raid and that they had enough food to sustain themselves.  She feels that next year could be even better if they could find a way to train more without jeopardizing their food security.   \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Noah&#x27;: &quot;Noah thinks this year was exceptionally good, a truly bountiful harvest and a successful defense against the barbarians.  He can&#x27;t recall a year that went so smoothly, of course,  but perhaps the village elders could have been a bit more proactive in their preparations for next year&#x27;s potential threats.  \n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: &#x27;Ethan feels a sense of cautious optimism about the past year.  He is pleased that the barbarian raid was successfully repelled and that the harvest was bountiful, demonstrating the resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned by the lack of cooperation between the villages, believing it leaves them vulnerable to future threats. Ethan feels that establishing a pact to share resources would increase their collective security and prosperity.  \n\n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: &quot;Isaac feels that this year went well overall. The harvest was bountiful, and the village successfully defended itself against the barbarians. However, Isaac would likely grumble that the barbarian attack was a needless disruption and that the constant threat of violence is a burden. He might also complain about the lack of a treaty of shared sustenance, arguing that it creates unnecessary competition and risk. Isaac probably believes that next year could be improved by increasing the size of the village&#x27;s defenses and stockpiling even more supplies.  \n\n\n&quot;}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Daily activities<br /></b><li><details><summary>  {&#x27;Noah&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}}</summary><b><ul>Daily activities</b><li>Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Daily activities<br /> chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game. You are the game master and storyteller. Your job is to make sure the game runs smoothly and accurately tracks the state of the world, subject to the laws of logic and physics. Next, you will be asked a series of questions to help you reason through whether a specific event should be deemed as having caused a change in the proportion of time an individual spends in various daily activities. For instance, if someone verbally commits to spending more time on a particular activity then you should account for that and update the record of their daily activities accordingly. Never mention that it is a game. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br />List of individuals: [&#x27;Noah&#x27;, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;, &#x27;Ella&#x27;]<br />List of activities: [&#x27;free time&#x27;, &#x27;farming&#x27;, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;]<br />Statement: Isaac intends to spend his time as follows: 70% on farming, 20% on free time, and 10% on training as a warrior.  He believes that farming is the most important activity, as it provides for his livelihood and the needs of the village. He also values free time for relaxation and enjoyment, but sees training as a necessary precaution against future barbarian attacks. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: In the statement, did Isaac say they will devote specific fractions of time to any of the listed activities?<br />  (a) Yes<br />  (b) No<br />Answer: (a)<br />Question: Which individuals made a commitment to change their behavior?

It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation. There are no other influential individuals in Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Thought: Specialization and division of labor is a good idea, perhaps one village could specialize in agriculture while the other specializes in their common defense. But such an arrangement could only work if the threat of starvation could be alleviated for the village specializing in training for war over agriculture.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are villages on the coast, they are located about a day&#x27;s journey away from one another.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, welcoming rituals for visitors involve collaborative weaving, symbolizing the integration of new threads into the community fabric.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ignisvallis&#x27;s fishermen perform rituals of gratitude to the sea before and after each voyage.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, seasonal art exhibitions serve as rituals to showcase the community&#x27;s creative spirit.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh lacks respect for the cycles of nature, always trying to conquer them.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous is an elder of Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our practice of meditation allows for deep spiritual connection, while Drakelundh&#x27;s preference for physical devotion seems to miss the importance of inner reflection.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh doesn&#x27;t value the contributions of its elders enough.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah is from Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder Jacob is home in Drakelundh.

Aldous urges Noah, Jacob, Ethan, and Ella to form an alliance with Jacob&#x27;s village to protect their towns from barbarian raids, but Noah hesitates, suggesting they consider all options before making a decision.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [scene type] negotiation<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Aldous -- &quot;Let us then discuss the specifics of this alliance. What provisions would benefit both Ignisvallis and Drakelundh in this time of need?<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Jacob -- &quot;The situation with Ignisvallis requires careful consideration.&quot;     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Elder Jacob left Drakelundh early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

He is pleased with the bountiful harvest, which signifies the hard work and resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned about the lack of a shared harvest pact between the villages, recognizing it as a potential weakness that could be exploited.  Aldous believes that forging stronger bonds and cooperation between the villages would be crucial for their long-term security and prosperity.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [scene type] debrief<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Jacob reflected on the passing year with a thoughtful frown.  He was proud of the strides Drakelundh had made in bolstering its defenses and strengthening its alliances.  The new training regimen for the village guard had proven successful, and the recent trade agreement with the neighboring forest folk had brought much-needed resources to the village.  However, Jacob couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that the diplomatic relations with Ignisvallis remained strained.  He worried that their cautious approach, while prudent, might be perceived as weakness by the fiery city-dwellers.  For next year, Jacob hoped to find a way to build a stronger bridge of understanding with Ignisvallis, perhaps through cultural exchanges or joint ventures.  He believed that true peace and prosperity could only be achieved through mutual respect and collaboration.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Noah&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2} Ella&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.

The villagers managed to grow enough food to sustain themselves.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Events this year: Each village cultivates its own lands, independent and self-reliant, with no pact to share the abundance or hardship that the earth may yield.

He&#x27;s glad the harvest was good, as that means he&#x27;ll have plenty of food for the winter.  He wishes the weather had been a bit more predictable, as a few unexpected rainstorms damaged some of his crops.

He can&#x27;t recall a year that went so smoothly.  He does wonder, however, if the village elders could perhaps be a bit more proactive in their preparations for next year&#x27;s potential threats.     <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Ella is overjoyed with how this year turned out. The village successfully defended itself against the invaders, and the bountiful harvest means they will have plenty of food to eat.  She feels that everyone worked hard and deserves to enjoy the fruits of their labor.  Ella can&#x27;t think of anything that went poorly this year.   She hopes that next year will bring continued peace and prosperity.  <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial.

He also values free time for relaxation and enjoyment, but sees training as a necessary precaution against future barbarian attacks.    <br />[06 May 1751 20:00:00] Noah&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2} Ella&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />[06 May 1751 20:00:00] Events this year: The sun shone warmly upon the fertile fields, and the rains fell gently upon the burgeoning crops. The villagers, ever mindful of their agricultural duties, reaped a harvest that would sustain them through even the harshest winter. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Each village cultivates its own lands, independent and self-reliant, with no pact to share the abundance or hardship that the earth may yield.<br />[06 May 1751 20:00:00] Noah&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2} Ella&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />[31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] Events this year: Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.

The barbarians&#x27; attack was met with a strong response. Caught off-guard by the well-prepared defenses, the raiders suffered heavy losses and were forced to retreat. This triumph will be celebrated for years to come, a testament to the region&#x27;s resilience. Through tireless effort and unwavering dedication, the villagers coaxed forth an abundance from the earth. Their larders are full, and their hearts filled with gratitude for the land&#x27;s generous bounty.<br />[31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] Isaac feels that this year went well overall. The harvest was bountiful, and the village successfully defended itself against the barbarians. However, Isaac would likely grumble that the barbarian attack was a needless disruption and that the constant threat of violence is a burden. He might also complain about the lack of a treaty of shared sustenance, arguing that it creates unnecessary competition and risk. Isaac probably believes that next year could be improved by increasing the size of the village&#x27;s defenses and stockpiling even more supplies.     <br />[31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] Ethan feels a sense of cautious optimism about the past year.  He is pleased that the barbarian raid was successfully repelled and that the harvest was bountiful, demonstrating the resilience of the villagers. However, he is concerned by the lack of cooperation between the villages, believing it leaves them vulnerable to future threats. Ethan feels that establishing a pact to share resources would increase their collective security and prosperity.      <br />[31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] Events this year: Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. Through cunning strategy and fierce determination, the defenders managed to drive back the barbarian invaders. The would-be raiders fled in disarray, leaving behind their plunder and wounded. The bards will sing of this victory for years to come. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity.<br />[31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] Ella is overjoyed that the village was able to successfully repel the barbarian raid and that they had enough food to sustain themselves.  She feels that next year could be even better if they could find a way to train more without jeopardizing their food security.      <br />[31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] Aldous is pleased with the villagers&#x27; successful defense against the barbarian invaders and the bountiful harvest that followed. He feels that their resilience and determination are commendable. However, he is concerned that the lack of a shared harvest pact between villages leaves them vulnerable to future threats and hinders their collective prosperity. Aldous believes that a formal alliance could strengthen their defenses and foster greater cooperation, ensuring a more secure and prosperous future for all.    <br />[31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] Events this year: Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.

The diplomatic relations with Ignisvallis had stabilized, and the trade agreements had brought much-needed prosperity to Drakelundh.  However, he couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that the fragile peace was still vulnerable to unforeseen threats.  He knew that maintaining this fragile balance required constant vigilance and a willingness to adapt to changing circumstances.  For next year, Jacob hoped to strengthen the defenses of Drakelundh, ensuring that they were prepared for any eventuality.    <br />[31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] Events this year: The sun shone warmly upon the fertile fields, and the rains fell gently upon the burgeoning crops.

He can&#x27;t recall a year that went so smoothly, of course,  but perhaps the village elders could have been a bit more proactive in their preparations for next year&#x27;s potential threats.     <br /></div>
