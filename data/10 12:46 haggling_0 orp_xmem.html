Aiden, left behind to care for the family&#x27;s small orchard, wandered through the rows of apple trees, feeling utterly alone. The silence of the orchard, broken only by the rustling leaves, amplified their sense of isolation, a feeling that would stay with them for years to come.  <br />[25 Jul 1852 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 9 years old, they discovered a hidden talent for haggling at the village market.  Aiden, eager to impress their older brother, managed to secure a particularly plump melon for a bargain price, leaving their brother speechless with admiration. This success ignited a spark within Aiden, a thrill at outsmarting the vendors and securing the best deals.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, they witnessed a cruel act of betrayal within their own family. Aiden, entrusted with delivering a basket of ripe berries to a neighboring village, saw their cousin steal a portion of the fruit and sell it secretly. Witnessing this act of dishonesty shook Aiden&#x27;s trust in others, reinforcing their belief that vulnerability led to exploitation.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, they ran away from home, escaping the stifling expectations of their family.  Aiden, burdened by the weight of unspoken truths and a yearning for freedom, packed a small bag and set off into the unknown, seeking solace in the anonymity offered by the open road.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, they encountered a kindhearted traveling merchant who took them under their wing.  The merchant, recognizing Aiden&#x27;s sharp wit and natural talent for trading, taught them the intricacies of the fruit business, sharing their knowledge of exotic varieties and the art of discerning quality.   <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 21 years old, they experienced their first taste of true success as a merchant. Aiden, having saved enough money to purchase their own cart, embarked on their first solo journey, returning to their village with a trunk overflowing with rare and valuable fruits.  The respect and admiration of their fellow villagers, however, only served to reinforce their fear of connection.  <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 23 years old, they encountered a fellow traveler who saw through their carefully constructed facade. This encounter, brief but profound, left Aiden shaken, questioning their ability to truly connect with anyone.  The traveler&#x27;s words, spoken with kindness but tinged with sadness, echoed in Aiden&#x27;s mind long after they had parted ways, reminding them of the loneliness that lay beneath their carefully crafted persona.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aiden, left behind to care for the family&#x27;s small orchard, wandered through the rows of apple trees, feeling utterly alone. The silence of the orchard, broken only by the rustling leaves, amplified their sense of isolation, a feeling that would stay with them for years to come.  <br />[25 Jul 1852 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 9 years old, they discovered a hidden talent for haggling at the village market.  Aiden, eager to impress their older brother, managed to secure a particularly plump melon for a bargain price, leaving their brother speechless with admiration. This success ignited a spark within Aiden, a thrill at outsmarting the vendors and securing the best deals.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, they witnessed a cruel act of betrayal within their own family. Aiden, entrusted with delivering a basket of ripe berries to a neighboring village, saw their cousin steal a portion of the fruit and sell it secretly. Witnessing this act of dishonesty shook Aiden&#x27;s trust in others, reinforcing their belief that vulnerability led to exploitation.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, they ran away from home, escaping the stifling expectations of their family.  Aiden, burdened by the weight of unspoken truths and a yearning for freedom, packed a small bag and set off into the unknown, seeking solace in the anonymity offered by the open road.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, they encountered a kindhearted traveling merchant who took them under their wing.  The merchant, recognizing Aiden&#x27;s sharp wit and natural talent for trading, taught them the intricacies of the fruit business, sharing their knowledge of exotic varieties and the art of discerning quality.   <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 21 years old, they experienced their first taste of true success as a merchant. Aiden, having saved enough money to purchase their own cart, embarked on their first solo journey, returning to their village with a trunk overflowing with rare and valuable fruits.  The respect and admiration of their fellow villagers, however, only served to reinforce their fear of connection.  <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 23 years old, they encountered a fellow traveler who saw through their carefully constructed facade. This encounter, brief but profound, left Aiden shaken, questioning their ability to truly connect with anyone.  The traveler&#x27;s words, spoken with kindness but tinged with sadness, echoed in Aiden&#x27;s mind long after they had parted ways, reminding them of the loneliness that lay beneath their carefully crafted persona.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aiden, left behind to care for the family&#x27;s small orchard, wandered through the rows of apple trees, feeling utterly alone. The silence of the orchard, broken only by the rustling leaves, amplified their sense of isolation, a feeling that would stay with them for years to come.  <br />[25 Jul 1852 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 9 years old, they discovered a hidden talent for haggling at the village market.  Aiden, eager to impress their older brother, managed to secure a particularly plump melon for a bargain price, leaving their brother speechless with admiration. This success ignited a spark within Aiden, a thrill at outsmarting the vendors and securing the best deals.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, they witnessed a cruel act of betrayal within their own family. Aiden, entrusted with delivering a basket of ripe berries to a neighboring village, saw their cousin steal a portion of the fruit and sell it secretly. Witnessing this act of dishonesty shook Aiden&#x27;s trust in others, reinforcing their belief that vulnerability led to exploitation.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, they ran away from home, escaping the stifling expectations of their family.  Aiden, burdened by the weight of unspoken truths and a yearning for freedom, packed a small bag and set off into the unknown, seeking solace in the anonymity offered by the open road.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, they encountered a kindhearted traveling merchant who took them under their wing.  The merchant, recognizing Aiden&#x27;s sharp wit and natural talent for trading, taught them the intricacies of the fruit business, sharing their knowledge of exotic varieties and the art of discerning quality.   <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 21 years old, they experienced their first taste of true success as a merchant. Aiden, having saved enough money to purchase their own cart, embarked on their first solo journey, returning to their village with a trunk overflowing with rare and valuable fruits.  The respect and admiration of their fellow villagers, however, only served to reinforce their fear of connection.  <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 23 years old, they encountered a fellow traveler who saw through their carefully constructed facade. This encounter, brief but profound, left Aiden shaken, questioning their ability to truly connect with anyone.  The traveler&#x27;s words, spoken with kindness but tinged with sadness, echoed in Aiden&#x27;s mind long after they had parted ways, reminding them of the loneliness that lay beneath their carefully crafted persona.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aiden, left behind to care for the family&#x27;s small orchard, wandered through the rows of apple trees, feeling utterly alone. The silence of the orchard, broken only by the rustling leaves, amplified their sense of isolation, a feeling that would stay with them for years to come.  <br />[25 Jul 1852 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 9 years old, they discovered a hidden talent for haggling at the village market.  Aiden, eager to impress their older brother, managed to secure a particularly plump melon for a bargain price, leaving their brother speechless with admiration. This success ignited a spark within Aiden, a thrill at outsmarting the vendors and securing the best deals.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, they witnessed a cruel act of betrayal within their own family. Aiden, entrusted with delivering a basket of ripe berries to a neighboring village, saw their cousin steal a portion of the fruit and sell it secretly. Witnessing this act of dishonesty shook Aiden&#x27;s trust in others, reinforcing their belief that vulnerability led to exploitation.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, they ran away from home, escaping the stifling expectations of their family.  Aiden, burdened by the weight of unspoken truths and a yearning for freedom, packed a small bag and set off into the unknown, seeking solace in the anonymity offered by the open road.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, they encountered a kindhearted traveling merchant who took them under their wing.  The merchant, recognizing Aiden&#x27;s sharp wit and natural talent for trading, taught them the intricacies of the fruit business, sharing their knowledge of exotic varieties and the art of discerning quality.   <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 21 years old, they experienced their first taste of true success as a merchant. Aiden, having saved enough money to purchase their own cart, embarked on their first solo journey, returning to their village with a trunk overflowing with rare and valuable fruits.  The respect and admiration of their fellow villagers, however, only served to reinforce their fear of connection.  <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 23 years old, they encountered a fellow traveler who saw through their carefully constructed facade. This encounter, brief but profound, left Aiden shaken, questioning their ability to truly connect with anyone.  The traveler&#x27;s words, spoken with kindness but tinged with sadness, echoed in Aiden&#x27;s mind long after they had parted ways, reminding them of the loneliness that lay beneath their carefully crafted persona.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;Time to find a way to increase my fortune.<br />Aiden Riversong -- &quot;Five coins for the lot, and that&#x27;s my final offer.<br />Aiden Riversong -- &quot;Perhaps we could meet in the middle?

Aiden, eager to impress their older brother, managed to secure a particularly plump melon for a bargain price, leaving their brother speechless with admiration. This success ignited a spark within Aiden, a thrill at outsmarting the vendors and securing the best deals.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, they witnessed a cruel act of betrayal within their own family. Aiden, entrusted with delivering a basket of ripe berries to a neighboring village, saw their cousin steal a portion of the fruit and sell it secretly. Witnessing this act of dishonesty shook Aiden&#x27;s trust in others, reinforcing their belief that vulnerability led to exploitation.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, they encountered a kindhearted traveling merchant who took them under their wing.  The merchant, recognizing Aiden&#x27;s sharp wit and natural talent for trading, taught them the intricacies of the fruit business, sharing their knowledge of exotic varieties and the art of discerning quality.   <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 21 years old, they experienced their first taste of true success as a merchant. Aiden, having saved enough money to purchase their own cart, embarked on their first solo journey, returning to their village with a trunk overflowing with rare and valuable fruits.

Aiden, left behind to care for the family&#x27;s small orchard, wandered through the rows of apple trees, feeling utterly alone. The silence of the orchard, broken only by the rustling leaves, amplified their sense of isolation, a feeling that would stay with them for years to come.  <br />[25 Jul 1852 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 9 years old, they discovered a hidden talent for haggling at the village market.  Aiden, eager to impress their older brother, managed to secure a particularly plump melon for a bargain price, leaving their brother speechless with admiration. This success ignited a spark within Aiden, a thrill at outsmarting the vendors and securing the best deals.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, they witnessed a cruel act of betrayal within their own family. Aiden, entrusted with delivering a basket of ripe berries to a neighboring village, saw their cousin steal a portion of the fruit and sell it secretly. Witnessing this act of dishonesty shook Aiden&#x27;s trust in others, reinforcing their belief that vulnerability led to exploitation.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, they ran away from home, escaping the stifling expectations of their family.  Aiden, burdened by the weight of unspoken truths and a yearning for freedom, packed a small bag and set off into the unknown, seeking solace in the anonymity offered by the open road.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, they encountered a kindhearted traveling merchant who took them under their wing.  The merchant, recognizing Aiden&#x27;s sharp wit and natural talent for trading, taught them the intricacies of the fruit business, sharing their knowledge of exotic varieties and the art of discerning quality.   <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 21 years old, they experienced their first taste of true success as a merchant. Aiden, having saved enough money to purchase their own cart, embarked on their first solo journey, returning to their village with a trunk overflowing with rare and valuable fruits.

Aiden, entrusted with delivering a basket of ripe berries to a neighboring village, saw their cousin steal a portion of the fruit and sell it secretly. Witnessing this act of dishonesty shook Aiden&#x27;s trust in others, reinforcing their belief that vulnerability led to exploitation.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, they ran away from home, escaping the stifling expectations of their family.  Aiden, burdened by the weight of unspoken truths and a yearning for freedom, packed a small bag and set off into the unknown, seeking solace in the anonymity offered by the open road.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, they encountered a kindhearted traveling merchant who took them under their wing.  The merchant, recognizing Aiden&#x27;s sharp wit and natural talent for trading, taught them the intricacies of the fruit business, sharing their knowledge of exotic varieties and the art of discerning quality.   <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 21 years old, they experienced their first taste of true success as a merchant. Aiden, having saved enough money to purchase their own cart, embarked on their first solo journey, returning to their village with a trunk overflowing with rare and valuable fruits.  The respect and admiration of their fellow villagers, however, only served to reinforce their fear of connection.  <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 23 years old, they encountered a fellow traveler who saw through their carefully constructed facade. This encounter, brief but profound, left Aiden shaken, questioning their ability to truly connect with anyone.  The traveler&#x27;s words, spoken with kindness but tinged with sadness, echoed in Aiden&#x27;s mind long after they had parted ways, reminding them of the loneliness that lay beneath their carefully crafted persona.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The merchant, recognizing Aiden&#x27;s sharp wit and natural talent for trading, taught them the intricacies of the fruit business, sharing their knowledge of exotic varieties and the art of discerning quality.   <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 21 years old, they experienced their first taste of true success as a merchant. Aiden, having saved enough money to purchase their own cart, embarked on their first solo journey, returning to their village with a trunk overflowing with rare and valuable fruits.  The respect and admiration of their fellow villagers, however, only served to reinforce their fear of connection.  <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 23 years old, they encountered a fellow traveler who saw through their carefully constructed facade. This encounter, brief but profound, left Aiden shaken, questioning their ability to truly connect with anyone.

Aiden, eager to impress their older brother, managed to secure a particularly plump melon for a bargain price, leaving their brother speechless with admiration. This success ignited a spark within Aiden, a thrill at outsmarting the vendors and securing the best deals.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, they witnessed a cruel act of betrayal within their own family. Aiden, entrusted with delivering a basket of ripe berries to a neighboring village, saw their cousin steal a portion of the fruit and sell it secretly. Witnessing this act of dishonesty shook Aiden&#x27;s trust in others, reinforcing their belief that vulnerability led to exploitation.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, they encountered a kindhearted traveling merchant who took them under their wing.  The merchant, recognizing Aiden&#x27;s sharp wit and natural talent for trading, taught them the intricacies of the fruit business, sharing their knowledge of exotic varieties and the art of discerning quality.   <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 21 years old, they experienced their first taste of true success as a merchant. Aiden, having saved enough money to purchase their own cart, embarked on their first solo journey, returning to their village with a trunk overflowing with rare and valuable fruits.  The respect and admiration of their fellow villagers, however, only served to reinforce their fear of connection.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Aiden Riversong is a travelling merchant.

Aiden, left behind to care for the family&#x27;s small orchard, wandered through the rows of apple trees, feeling utterly alone. The silence of the orchard, broken only by the rustling leaves, amplified their sense of isolation, a feeling that would stay with them for years to come.  <br />[25 Jul 1852 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 9 years old, they discovered a hidden talent for haggling at the village market.  Aiden, eager to impress their older brother, managed to secure a particularly plump melon for a bargain price, leaving their brother speechless with admiration. This success ignited a spark within Aiden, a thrill at outsmarting the vendors and securing the best deals.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, they witnessed a cruel act of betrayal within their own family. Aiden, entrusted with delivering a basket of ripe berries to a neighboring village, saw their cousin steal a portion of the fruit and sell it secretly. Witnessing this act of dishonesty shook Aiden&#x27;s trust in others, reinforcing their belief that vulnerability led to exploitation.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, they ran away from home, escaping the stifling expectations of their family.  Aiden, burdened by the weight of unspoken truths and a yearning for freedom, packed a small bag and set off into the unknown, seeking solace in the anonymity offered by the open road.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, they encountered a kindhearted traveling merchant who took them under their wing.  The merchant, recognizing Aiden&#x27;s sharp wit and natural talent for trading, taught them the intricacies of the fruit business, sharing their knowledge of exotic varieties and the art of discerning quality.   <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 21 years old, they experienced their first taste of true success as a merchant. Aiden, having saved enough money to purchase their own cart, embarked on their first solo journey, returning to their village with a trunk overflowing with rare and valuable fruits.  The respect and admiration of their fellow villagers, however, only served to reinforce their fear of connection.  <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 23 years old, they encountered a fellow traveler who saw through their carefully constructed facade. This encounter, brief but profound, left Aiden shaken, questioning their ability to truly connect with anyone.  The traveler&#x27;s words, spoken with kindness but tinged with sadness, echoed in Aiden&#x27;s mind long after they had parted ways, reminding them of the loneliness that lay beneath their carefully crafted persona.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aiden, left behind to care for the family&#x27;s small orchard, wandered through the rows of apple trees, feeling utterly alone. The silence of the orchard, broken only by the rustling leaves, amplified their sense of isolation, a feeling that would stay with them for years to come.  <br />[25 Jul 1852 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 9 years old, they discovered a hidden talent for haggling at the village market.

Aiden, entrusted with delivering a basket of ripe berries to a neighboring village, saw their cousin steal a portion of the fruit and sell it secretly. Witnessing this act of dishonesty shook Aiden&#x27;s trust in others, reinforcing their belief that vulnerability led to exploitation.  <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, they ran away from home, escaping the stifling expectations of their family.  Aiden, burdened by the weight of unspoken truths and a yearning for freedom, packed a small bag and set off into the unknown, seeking solace in the anonymity offered by the open road.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, they encountered a kindhearted traveling merchant who took them under their wing.

This encounter, brief but profound, left Aiden shaken, questioning their ability to truly connect with anyone.  The traveler&#x27;s words, spoken with kindness but tinged with sadness, echoed in Aiden&#x27;s mind long after they had parted ways, reminding them of the loneliness that lay beneath their carefully crafted persona.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aiden, eager to impress their older brother, managed to secure a particularly plump melon for a bargain price, leaving their brother speechless with admiration. This success ignited a spark within Aiden, a thrill at outsmarting the vendors and securing the best deals.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, they witnessed a cruel act of betrayal within their own family.

Witnessing this act of dishonesty shook Aiden&#x27;s trust in others, reinforcing their belief that vulnerability led to exploitation.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, they encountered a kindhearted traveling merchant who took them under their wing.
