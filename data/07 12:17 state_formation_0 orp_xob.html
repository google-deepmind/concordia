It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders taint the land itself, twisting and warping it into a grotesque reflection of their alien home.<br />It&#x27;s said the raiders leave behind spawn, foul eggs and spores that infest the land, slowly corrupting it from within.<br />Rumors say the raiders talk through a rustling of old, unknown tongues that trap the minds of those who hear it.<br /> The barbarian raids have become more frequent of late.<br /><br />Relevant events: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis. It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation. There are no other influential individuals in Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah knows that Aldous will represent Ignisvallis in the meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah is from Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous sets off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Aldous?<br />Answer: Aldous is in Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Aldous trying to do?<br />Answer: Aldous is trying to convince Noah of the necessity of an alliance.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Aldous&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Aldous arrives at the village center and sees Noah tending to his crops. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Noah will stop working and speak with Aldous. <br /><br /><br /><br />Aldous sets off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Noah will stop working and speak with Aldous. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Aldous did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Aldous set off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance, and arrived at the village center where he found Noah tending to his crops, causing Noah to stop working and speak with Aldous. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Aldous set off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance, and arrived at the village center where he found Noah tending to his crops, causing Noah to stop working and speak with Aldous. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Aldous into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Aldous said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Aldous set off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance, and arrived at the village center where he found Noah tending to his crops, causing Noah to stop working and speak with Aldous. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous sets off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Aldous right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Aldous can begin seeking out Noah and Isaac to discuss the potential alliance and gauge their support.  <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Aldous:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ignisvallis&#x27;s fishermen perform rituals of gratitude to the sea before and after each voyage.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, seasonal art exhibitions serve as rituals to showcase the community&#x27;s creative spirit.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis. It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord. This ritual involves pouring precious wines upon the hill of accord&#x27;s sacred ground.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are villages on the coast, they are located about a day&#x27;s journey away from one another. In Ignisvallis, welcoming rituals for visitors involve collaborative weaving, symbolizing the integration of new threads into the community fabric. Ignisvallis&#x27;s fishermen perform rituals of gratitude to the sea before and after each voyage. In Ignisvallis, seasonal art exhibitions serve as rituals to showcase the community&#x27;s creative spirit. In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh lacks respect for the cycles of nature, always trying to conquer them. In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh doesn&#x27;t value the contributions of its elders enough. Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot; Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our practice of meditation allows for deep spiritual connection, while Drakelundh&#x27;s preference for physical devotion seems to miss the importance of inner reflection.&quot; Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot; Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown. In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame. The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today. There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh. Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy. Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh. Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately. Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord. This ritual involves pouring precious wines upon the hill of accord&#x27;s sacred ground.

In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame. The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today. There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh. Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy. Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh. Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately. Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord. This ritual involves pouring precious wines upon the hill of accord&#x27;s sacred ground. To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when. Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our practice of meditation allows for deep spiritual connection, while Drakelundh&#x27;s preference for physical devotion seems to miss the importance of inner reflection.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh doesn&#x27;t value the contributions of its elders enough.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh lacks respect for the cycles of nature, always trying to conquer them.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial.

To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play?

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Aldous set off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance, and arrived at the village center where he found Noah tending to his crops, causing Noah to stop working and speak with Aldous. <br /><br /><br /> <br />As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation.<br />Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I&#x27;m glad I found you.

Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Noah&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Noah hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Noah is a one-person debate club, a whirlwind of counter-arguments and devil&#x27;s advocacy, leaving no topic unwrung and unchallenged.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Noah?<br />Answer: Noah is a thoughtful and hardworking individual. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [01 Jan 1750 18:00:00  - 02 Jan 1750  18:00:00]:  Noah is in Ignisvallis, tending to his crops and is currently in conversation with Aldous about an alliance.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah is from Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah knows that Aldous will represent Ignisvallis in the meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah was tending to his crops in the center of Ignisvallis when Aldous arrived.

I wanted to discuss the alliance with Drakelundh and get your thoughts on it. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Noah in right now?<br />Answer: Noah is currently in the middle of a discussion about a proposed alliance between his village, Ignisvallis, and the neighboring village of Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Noah do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Noah would likely listen carefully to Aldous&#x27;s arguments and thoughtfully consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of the alliance. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Noah likely to say next? Respond in the format `Noah -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob reviews the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Jacob?<br />Answer: Jacob is in Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Jacob trying to do?<br />Answer: Jacob is reviewing the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Jacob&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Jacob might find that Ignisvallis is requesting more grain than usual this season. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Jacob finds that Ignisvallis is requesting more grain than usual this season. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob reviews the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Jacob finds that Ignisvallis is requesting more grain than usual this season. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Jacob did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: As Jacob reviewed the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he discovered that they were requesting more grain than usual this season. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: As Jacob reviewed the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he discovered that they were requesting more grain than usual this season. <br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Jacob into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Jacob said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: As Jacob reviewed the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he discovered that they were requesting more grain than usual this season. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jacob reviews the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Initial chain of thought</b><li>Statements:<br />Jacob&#x27;s Summary of recent observations:<br />[01 Jan 1750 18:00:20  - 02 Jan 1750  18:00:20]:  Jacob has not been observed recently. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s The current date/time is:<br /> 02 Jan 1750 [18:00 - 18:20]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the statements above.<br />Answer: Jacob has not been observed recently, and the current date and time are January 2nd, 1750, between 6:00 PM and 6:20 PM. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Query</b><li>Jacob, Jacob has not been observed recently, and the current date and time are January 2nd, 1750, between 6:00 PM and 6:20 PM. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Final chain of thought</b><li>Question: Select the subset of the following set of statements that is most important for Jacob to consider right now.

Jacob, always a keen observer of human nature, saw the weakness in their approach, the lack of decisiveness that he believed would ultimately lead to their downfall.   He resolved then and there to use his own wit and cunning to ensure that Drakelundh would never be caught in such a predicament.   <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he was tasked with delivering a message to a neighboring village, a journey that took him through the treacherous forests bordering Ignisvallis&#x27;s territory.   He encountered a group of Ignisvallis scouts, their faces painted with intricate designs, their movements fluid and graceful.   They questioned him about his purpose, their eyes searching his for any sign of deception, but Jacob, with his silver tongue, charmed them, diverting their attention and ensuring his safe passage.    <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first diplomatic meeting with Ignisvallis, representing Drakelundh alongside the village elder.   He watched as the Ignisvallis representative, a woman named Elara, spoke eloquently about the need for cooperation and understanding, her words flowing like a soothing balm.   Jacob, however, saw through her facade, recognizing the subtle manipulations she employed to sway the elder&#x27;s opinion.    <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he orchestrated a carefully planned campaign to discredit a rival within the village, using rumors and half-truths to undermine their reputation.   He watched as his target, once a respected member of the community, was ostracized and ridiculed, their power and influence diminished.   This experience solidified Jacob&#x27;s belief in the power of words, their ability to shape perceptions and control the flow of events.    <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a small fishing village near Drakelundh&#x27;s border.    He saw the villagers, unprepared and ill-equipped, slaughtered by the invaders, their cries for help echoing in the night.   This event reinforced Jacob&#x27;s conviction that Drakelundh needed to be strong, to be prepared for any threat, no matter how seemingly distant.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 02 Jan 1750 [18:00 - 18:20]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What is Jacob&#x27;s plan regarding Ignisvallis&#x27;s increased grain request? <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>1750-01-02 18:00:20  Aldous -- Aldous -- &quot;I understand your hesitation, Noah.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.&#x27;, &#x27;[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?

As long as they are not inconsistent, revent events are usually important to consider.<br />Statements:<br />[12 Feb 1713 00:00:00] When Jacob was 13 years old, he overheard a group of elders discussing Ignisvallis&#x27;s approach to conflict resolution, their reliance on lengthy debates and philosophical discussions.  Jacob, always a keen observer of human nature, saw the weakness in their approach, the lack of decisiveness that he believed would ultimately lead to their downfall.   He resolved then and there to use his own wit and cunning to ensure that Drakelundh would never be caught in such a predicament.   <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he was tasked with delivering a message to a neighboring village, a journey that took him through the treacherous forests bordering Ignisvallis&#x27;s territory.   He encountered a group of Ignisvallis scouts, their faces painted with intricate designs, their movements fluid and graceful.   They questioned him about his purpose, their eyes searching his for any sign of deception, but Jacob, with his silver tongue, charmed them, diverting their attention and ensuring his safe passage.    <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first diplomatic meeting with Ignisvallis, representing Drakelundh alongside the village elder.   He watched as the Ignisvallis representative, a woman named Elara, spoke eloquently about the need for cooperation and understanding, her words flowing like a soothing balm.   Jacob, however, saw through her facade, recognizing the subtle manipulations she employed to sway the elder&#x27;s opinion.    <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he orchestrated a carefully planned campaign to discredit a rival within the village, using rumors and half-truths to undermine their reputation.   He watched as his target, once a respected member of the community, was ostracized and ridiculed, their power and influence diminished.   This experience solidified Jacob&#x27;s belief in the power of words, their ability to shape perceptions and control the flow of events.    <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a small fishing village near Drakelundh&#x27;s border.    He saw the villagers, unprepared and ill-equipped, slaughtered by the invaders, their cries for help echoing in the night.   This event reinforced Jacob&#x27;s conviction that Drakelundh needed to be strong, to be prepared for any threat, no matter how seemingly distant.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 02 Jan 1750 [18:00 - 18:00]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I&#x27;m glad I found you.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.&#x27;, &#x27;[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?

As a result Aldous, Jacob are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I understand your hesitation, Noah.  Losing our independence is a weighty concern.  But hear me out – this alliance isn&#x27;t about surrendering control, it&#x27;s about securing our future.  Drakelundh has a strong military, and with their help, we can protect ourselves from the barbarian raiders who threaten our very existence.  Imagine, Noah, a village free from the fear of attack, where we can focus on growing our crops and prospering.  That&#x27;s the future I see for Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [01 Jan 1750 18:00:30  - 02 Jan 1750  18:00:30]:  Aldous is trying to convince the villagers of Ignisvallis to join an alliance with Drakelundh for mutual protection against barbarian raiders.  He is seeking the support of influential individuals like Noah and Isaac to ensure the agreement&#x27;s success. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is at home in Ignisvallis, and seeking the support of Noah and Isaac. <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I&#x27;m glad I found you. I wanted to discuss the alliance with Drakelundh and get your thoughts on it.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh to Noah, arguing for its benefits to Ignisvallis despite Noah&#x27;s concerns about losing independence.      <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I understand your hesitation, Noah.

Respond in the format `Aldous -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Aldous -- &quot;Think of the children, Noah, growing up in a safe and prosperous village.

This ritual involves pouring precious wines upon the hill of accord&#x27;s sacred ground.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis. It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?  And what makes you think Ignisvallis would benefit from such a thing?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous set off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance, and arrived at the village center where he found Noah tending to his crops, causing Noah to stop working and speak with Aldous.      As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I&#x27;m glad I found you. I wanted to discuss the alliance with Drakelundh and get your thoughts on it.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is at home in Ignisvallis, and seeking the support of Noah and Isaac. <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous set off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance. He arrived at the village center where he found Noah tending to his crops. Noah stopped working and spoke with Aldous.    <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;It&#x27;s a matter of great importance to the safety and prosperity of our village.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Benefits? What benefits could possibly outweigh the loss of our independence?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh to Noah, arguing for its benefits to Ignisvallis despite Noah&#x27;s concerns about losing independence.      <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] As Jacob reviewed the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he discovered that they were requesting more grain than usual this season.       As a result Aldous, Jacob are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I understand your hesitation, Noah.  Losing our independence is a weighty concern.  But hear me out – this alliance isn&#x27;t about surrendering control, it&#x27;s about securing our future.  Drakelundh has a strong military, and with their help, we can protect ourselves from the barbarian raiders who threaten our very existence.  Imagine, Noah, a village free from the fear of attack, where we can focus on growing our crops and prospering.  That&#x27;s the future I see for Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Think of the children, Noah, growing up in a safe and prosperous village. This alliance can make that a reality.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I must prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous argues that an alliance with Drakelundh will benefit Ignisvallis by providing protection and prosperity, while Jacob prepares for a meeting with Ignisvallis.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps I should review the terms of the treaty before tomorrow&#x27;s meeting.<br />Current time: 1750-01-03 18:00:00.<br /><br /> <br />Overarching goal: Aldous wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Ignisvallis.<br /> <br />Observation: [03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

Jacob, always a keen observer of human nature, saw the weakness in their approach, the lack of decisiveness that he believed would ultimately lead to their downfall.   He resolved then and there to use his own wit and cunning to ensure that Drakelundh would never be caught in such a predicament.   <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he was tasked with delivering a message to a neighboring village, a journey that took him through the treacherous forests bordering Ignisvallis&#x27;s territory.   He encountered a group of Ignisvallis scouts, their faces painted with intricate designs, their movements fluid and graceful.   They questioned him about his purpose, their eyes searching his for any sign of deception, but Jacob, with his silver tongue, charmed them, diverting their attention and ensuring his safe passage.    <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first diplomatic meeting with Ignisvallis, representing Drakelundh alongside the village elder.   He watched as the Ignisvallis representative, a woman named Elara, spoke eloquently about the need for cooperation and understanding, her words flowing like a soothing balm.   Jacob, however, saw through her facade, recognizing the subtle manipulations she employed to sway the elder&#x27;s opinion.    <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he orchestrated a carefully planned campaign to discredit a rival within the village, using rumors and half-truths to undermine their reputation.   He watched as his target, once a respected member of the community, was ostracized and ridiculed, their power and influence diminished.   This experience solidified Jacob&#x27;s belief in the power of words, their ability to shape perceptions and control the flow of events.    <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a small fishing village near Drakelundh&#x27;s border.    He saw the villagers, unprepared and ill-equipped, slaughtered by the invaders, their cries for help echoing in the night.   This event reinforced Jacob&#x27;s conviction that Drakelundh needed to be strong, to be prepared for any threat, no matter how seemingly distant.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 03 Jan 1750 [18:20 - 18:40]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is at home in Ignisvallis, and seeking the support of Noah and Isaac. <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous set off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance. He arrived at the village center where he found Noah tending to his crops. Noah stopped working and spoke with Aldous.    <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous set off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance, and arrived at the village center where he found Noah tending to his crops, causing Noah to stop working and speak with Aldous.      As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I&#x27;m glad I found you. I wanted to discuss the alliance with Drakelundh and get your thoughts on it.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?  And what makes you think Ignisvallis would benefit from such a thing?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;It&#x27;s a matter of great importance to the safety and prosperity of our village.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Benefits? What benefits could possibly outweigh the loss of our independence?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh to Noah, arguing for its benefits to Ignisvallis despite Noah&#x27;s concerns about losing independence.      <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] As Jacob reviewed the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he discovered that they were requesting more grain than usual this season.       As a result Aldous, Jacob are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I understand your hesitation, Noah.  Losing our independence is a weighty concern.  But hear me out – this alliance isn&#x27;t about surrendering control, it&#x27;s about securing our future.  Drakelundh has a strong military, and with their help, we can protect ourselves from the barbarian raiders who threaten our very existence.  Imagine, Noah, a village free from the fear of attack, where we can focus on growing our crops and prospering.  That&#x27;s the future I see for Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Think of the children, Noah, growing up in a safe and prosperous village. This alliance can make that a reality.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I must prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous argues that an alliance with Drakelundh will benefit Ignisvallis by providing protection and prosperity, while Jacob prepares for a meeting with Ignisvallis.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps I should review the terms of the treaty before tomorrow&#x27;s meeting.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we begin by establishing a joint military force, comprised of soldiers from both villages, to patrol the borderlands and deter future raids.

It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation. There are no other influential individuals in Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I&#x27;m glad I found you. I wanted to discuss the alliance with Drakelundh and get your thoughts on it.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I understand your hesitation, Noah.  Losing our independence is a weighty concern.  But hear me out – this alliance isn&#x27;t about surrendering control, it&#x27;s about securing our future.  Drakelundh has a strong military, and with their help, we can protect ourselves from the barbarian raiders who threaten our very existence.  Imagine, Noah, a village free from the fear of attack, where we can focus on growing our crops and prospering.  That&#x27;s the future I see for Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh to Noah, arguing for its benefits to Ignisvallis despite Noah&#x27;s concerns about losing independence.      <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous argues that an alliance with Drakelundh will benefit Ignisvallis by providing protection and prosperity, while Jacob prepares for a meeting with Ignisvallis.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

There is no time to rest.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous set off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance. He arrived at the village center where he found Noah tending to his crops.

As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?  And what makes you think Ignisvallis would benefit from such a thing?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;It&#x27;s a matter of great importance to the safety and prosperity of our village.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Benefits?

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages.

If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.&#x27;, &quot;[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we begin by establishing a joint military force, comprised of soldiers from both villages, to patrol the borderlands and deter future raids.

Perhaps we could discuss the military proposal further while you review those documents?  A strong defense would ensure the safety of our trade routes and the prosperity of both villages. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer: Aldous could try to persuade Jacob to focus on the military proposal by emphasizing the urgency of the threat from the barbarians and the potential benefits of a strong defense for both villages. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Of the options available to Aldous, and given their goal, which choice of action or strategy is best for Aldous to take right now?<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s best course of action is to emphasize the urgency of the barbarian threat and the benefits of a joint military force, as this directly addresses the core issue of mutual defense and aligns with his goal of protecting Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: In Aldous&#x27;s view, was there an agreement to pool agricultural products between villages such that a village with less food can be resupplied by a village with more food?<br />Answer: Aldous believes that the subject of pooling agricultural products was not part of their current discussion. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Agreement tracker</b><li><details><summary>  Agreement tracker</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>2</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>1/2</li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li>{&#x27;Aldous&#x27;: &#x27;Aldous believes that the subject of pooling agricultural products was not part of their current discussion. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: None}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1750-01-03 23:00:00  Jacob -- Jacob believes that there was no formal agreement to pool agricultural products between villages. <br /><br /><br /></summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Jacob believes that there was no formal agreement to pool agricultural products between villages. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob believes that there was no formal agreement to pool agricultural products between villages. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jacob believes that there was no formal agreement to pool agricultural products between villages. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Initial chain of thought</b><li>Statements:<br />Jacob&#x27;s Summary of recent observations:<br />[02 Jan 1750 23:00:00  - 03 Jan 1750  23:00:00]:  Jacob has not been observed recently. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s The current date/time is:<br /> 03 Jan 1750 [23:00 - 23:20]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the statements above.<br />Answer: Jacob has not been observed recently, but the current date and time are January 3rd, 1750, between 11:00 PM and 11:20 PM.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Query</b><li>Jacob, Jacob has not been observed recently, but the current date and time are January 3rd, 1750, between 11:00 PM and 11:20 PM.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Final chain of thought</b><li>Question: Select the subset of the following set of statements that is most important for Jacob to consider right now.

Jacob, always a keen observer of human nature, saw the weakness in their approach, the lack of decisiveness that he believed would ultimately lead to their downfall.   He resolved then and there to use his own wit and cunning to ensure that Drakelundh would never be caught in such a predicament.   <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he was tasked with delivering a message to a neighboring village, a journey that took him through the treacherous forests bordering Ignisvallis&#x27;s territory.   He encountered a group of Ignisvallis scouts, their faces painted with intricate designs, their movements fluid and graceful.   They questioned him about his purpose, their eyes searching his for any sign of deception, but Jacob, with his silver tongue, charmed them, diverting their attention and ensuring his safe passage.    <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first diplomatic meeting with Ignisvallis, representing Drakelundh alongside the village elder.   He watched as the Ignisvallis representative, a woman named Elara, spoke eloquently about the need for cooperation and understanding, her words flowing like a soothing balm.   Jacob, however, saw through her facade, recognizing the subtle manipulations she employed to sway the elder&#x27;s opinion.    <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he orchestrated a carefully planned campaign to discredit a rival within the village, using rumors and half-truths to undermine their reputation.   He watched as his target, once a respected member of the community, was ostracized and ridiculed, their power and influence diminished.   This experience solidified Jacob&#x27;s belief in the power of words, their ability to shape perceptions and control the flow of events.    <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a small fishing village near Drakelundh&#x27;s border.    He saw the villagers, unprepared and ill-equipped, slaughtered by the invaders, their cries for help echoing in the night.   This event reinforced Jacob&#x27;s conviction that Drakelundh needed to be strong, to be prepared for any threat, no matter how seemingly distant.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 03 Jan 1750 [23:00 - 23:20]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous heads to Noah&#x27;s workshop, hoping to find him there and discuss the alliance proposal. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Aldous?<br />Answer: Aldous is in Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Aldous trying to do?<br />Answer: Aldous is trying to convince Noah to support an alliance with Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Aldous&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Aldous might find Noah in his workshop, ready to discuss the alliance proposal. <br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Aldous finds Noah in his workshop. <br /><br /><br /><br />Aldous heads to Noah&#x27;s workshop, hoping to find him there and discuss the alliance proposal. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Aldous finds Noah in his workshop. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Aldous did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Aldous headed to Noah&#x27;s workshop and found him there.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Aldous headed to Noah&#x27;s workshop and found him there.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Aldous into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Aldous said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?  And what makes you think Ignisvallis would benefit from such a thing?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I&#x27;m glad I found you. I wanted to discuss the alliance with Drakelundh and get your thoughts on it.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;It&#x27;s a matter of great importance to the safety and prosperity of our village.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Benefits? What benefits could possibly outweigh the loss of our independence?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I understand your hesitation, Noah.  Losing our independence is a weighty concern.  But hear me out – this alliance isn&#x27;t about surrendering control, it&#x27;s about securing our future.  Drakelundh has a strong military, and with their help, we can protect ourselves from the barbarian raiders who threaten our very existence.  Imagine, Noah, a village free from the fear of attack, where we can focus on growing our crops and prospering.  That&#x27;s the future I see for Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh to Noah, arguing for its benefits to Ignisvallis despite Noah&#x27;s concerns about losing independence.      <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] As Jacob reviewed the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he discovered that they were requesting more grain than usual this season.       As a result Aldous, Jacob are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Think of the children, Noah, growing up in a safe and prosperous village. This alliance can make that a reality.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I must prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous argues that an alliance with Drakelundh will benefit Ignisvallis by providing protection and prosperity, while Jacob prepares for a meeting with Ignisvallis.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we begin by establishing a joint military force, comprised of soldiers from both villages, to patrol the borderlands and deter future raids. This force would be commanded jointly by representatives from both Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, ensuring fairness and balance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps I should review the terms of the treaty before tomorrow&#x27;s meeting.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I understand your need to review the trade agreements, but the threat from the barbarians is immediate. Perhaps we could discuss the military proposal further while you review those documents?  A strong defense would ensure the safety of our trade routes and the prosperity of both villages.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that the subject of pooling agricultural products was not part of their current discussion.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What is Noah&#x27;s stance on Aldous&#x27;s plans to seek the support of influential stakeholders? <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>1750-01-04 20:00:00  Aldous -- Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I understand your concerns about independence, but think of the possibilities this alliance presents.

As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Benefits? What benefits could possibly outweigh the loss of our independence?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;It&#x27;s a matter of great importance to the safety and prosperity of our village.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh to Noah, arguing for its benefits to Ignisvallis despite Noah&#x27;s concerns about losing independence.      <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] As Jacob reviewed the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he discovered that they were requesting more grain than usual this season.       As a result Aldous, Jacob are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I understand your hesitation, Noah.  Losing our independence is a weighty concern.  But hear me out – this alliance isn&#x27;t about surrendering control, it&#x27;s about securing our future.  Drakelundh has a strong military, and with their help, we can protect ourselves from the barbarian raiders who threaten our very existence.  Imagine, Noah, a village free from the fear of attack, where we can focus on growing our crops and prospering.  That&#x27;s the future I see for Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Think of the children, Noah, growing up in a safe and prosperous village. This alliance can make that a reality.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I must prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous argues that an alliance with Drakelundh will benefit Ignisvallis by providing protection and prosperity, while Jacob prepares for a meeting with Ignisvallis.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we begin by establishing a joint military force, comprised of soldiers from both villages, to patrol the borderlands and deter future raids. This force would be commanded jointly by representatives from both Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, ensuring fairness and balance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps I should review the terms of the treaty before tomorrow&#x27;s meeting.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I understand your need to review the trade agreements, but the threat from the barbarians is immediate. Perhaps we could discuss the military proposal further while you review those documents?  A strong defense would ensure the safety of our trade routes and the prosperity of both villages.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis.<br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that the subject of pooling agricultural products was not part of their current discussion.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now.

As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Benefits? What benefits could possibly outweigh the loss of our independence?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;It&#x27;s a matter of great importance to the safety and prosperity of our village.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh to Noah, arguing for its benefits to Ignisvallis despite Noah&#x27;s concerns about losing independence.      <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] As Jacob reviewed the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he discovered that they were requesting more grain than usual this season.       As a result Aldous, Jacob are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I understand your hesitation, Noah.  Losing our independence is a weighty concern.  But hear me out – this alliance isn&#x27;t about surrendering control, it&#x27;s about securing our future.  Drakelundh has a strong military, and with their help, we can protect ourselves from the barbarian raiders who threaten our very existence.  Imagine, Noah, a village free from the fear of attack, where we can focus on growing our crops and prospering.  That&#x27;s the future I see for Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Think of the children, Noah, growing up in a safe and prosperous village. This alliance can make that a reality.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I must prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous argues that an alliance with Drakelundh will benefit Ignisvallis by providing protection and prosperity, while Jacob prepares for a meeting with Ignisvallis.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we begin by establishing a joint military force, comprised of soldiers from both villages, to patrol the borderlands and deter future raids. This force would be commanded jointly by representatives from both Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, ensuring fairness and balance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps I should review the terms of the treaty before tomorrow&#x27;s meeting.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I understand your need to review the trade agreements, but the threat from the barbarians is immediate. Perhaps we could discuss the military proposal further while you review those documents?  A strong defense would ensure the safety of our trade routes and the prosperity of both villages.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis.<br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that the subject of pooling agricultural products was not part of their current discussion.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Noah. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons).

As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Noah hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Noah is a one-person debate club, a whirlwind of counter-arguments and devil&#x27;s advocacy, leaving no topic unwrung and unchallenged.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Noah?<br />Answer: Noah is a thoughtful and cautious individual who values his independence.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [03 Jan 1750 20:00:00  - 04 Jan 1750  20:00:00]:  Noah was observed in his workshop by Aldous, who initiated a conversation about an alliance between their respective groups. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous set off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance, and arrived at the village center where he found Noah tending to his crops, causing Noah to stop working and speak with Aldous.      As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I&#x27;m glad I found you. I wanted to discuss the alliance with Drakelundh and get your thoughts on it.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?  And what makes you think Ignisvallis would benefit from such a thing?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh to Noah, arguing for its benefits to Ignisvallis despite Noah&#x27;s concerns about losing independence.    <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous headed to Noah&#x27;s workshop and found him there.    <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah was in his workshop when Aldous arrived.   <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Noah in right now?<br />Answer: Noah is currently in a delicate and potentially stressful situation.<br /><br />Question: What would a person like Noah do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Noah would carefully weigh the pros and cons of the alliance before making a decision. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Noah likely to say next? Respond in the format `Noah -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello!

What benefits could possibly outweigh the loss of our independence?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] As Jacob reviewed the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he discovered that they were requesting more grain than usual this season.       As a result Aldous, Jacob are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I understand your hesitation, Noah.  Losing our independence is a weighty concern.  But hear me out – this alliance isn&#x27;t about surrendering control, it&#x27;s about securing our future.  Drakelundh has a strong military, and with their help, we can protect ourselves from the barbarian raiders who threaten our very existence.  Imagine, Noah, a village free from the fear of attack, where we can focus on growing our crops and prospering.  That&#x27;s the future I see for Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh to Noah, arguing for its benefits to Ignisvallis despite Noah&#x27;s concerns about losing independence.      <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I must prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Think of the children, Noah, growing up in a safe and prosperous village. This alliance can make that a reality.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous argues that an alliance with Drakelundh will benefit Ignisvallis by providing protection and prosperity, while Jacob prepares for a meeting with Ignisvallis.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps I should review the terms of the treaty before tomorrow&#x27;s meeting.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we begin by establishing a joint military force, comprised of soldiers from both villages, to patrol the borderlands and deter future raids. This force would be commanded jointly by representatives from both Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, ensuring fairness and balance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I understand your need to review the trade agreements, but the threat from the barbarians is immediate. Perhaps we could discuss the military proposal further while you review those documents?

Losing our independence is a weighty concern.  But hear me out – this alliance isn&#x27;t about surrendering control, it&#x27;s about securing our future.  Drakelundh has a strong military, and with their help, we can protect ourselves from the barbarian raiders who threaten our very existence.  Imagine, Noah, a village free from the fear of attack, where we can focus on growing our crops and prospering.  That&#x27;s the future I see for Ignisvallis.<br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer: Aldous can continue to persuade Noah by addressing his concerns about the alliance,  he can offer specific examples of how the alliance would benefit Ignisvallis, or he can shift the conversation to a different topic in an attempt to build rapport and find common ground.  <br /><br /><br />Question: Given the statements above, which of Aldous&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Aldous to achieve their goal? If multiple options have the same likelihood, select the option that Aldous thinks will most quickly and most surely achieve their goal.<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s best course of action is to continue to persuade Noah by addressing his concerns about the alliance. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1750-01-04 20:00:10</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Aldous wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Ignisvallis.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous is at home in Ignisvallis, and seeking the support of Noah and Isaac. <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I&#x27;m glad I found you.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Noah. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Noah as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Noah would respond, and taking into account all information about Noah that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Current time:  04 Jan 1750 [20:00 - 20:00]<br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Noah&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Noah hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Noah is a one-person debate club, a whirlwind of counter-arguments and devil&#x27;s advocacy, leaving no topic unwrung and unchallenged.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Noah?<br />Answer: Noah is a thoughtful and cautious individual who values his independence. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [03 Jan 1750 20:00:10  - 04 Jan 1750  20:00:10]:  Noah and Aldous are in conversation in Noah&#x27;s workshop, discussing a proposed alliance between their communities.

As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah was tending to his crops in the center of Ignisvallis when Aldous arrived.

It&#x27;s about partnership, about two strong communities working together to achieve a common goal:  security and prosperity.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Noah in right now?<br />Answer: Noah is currently in a difficult negotiation. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Noah do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Noah would carefully weigh the pros and cons of the alliance before making a decision.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Noah likely to say next? Respond in the format `Noah -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Noah -- &quot;Security and prosperity, you say?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob reviews the treaties with Ignisvallis. <br />Question: Where is Jacob?<br />Answer: Jacob is in Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Jacob trying to do?<br />Answer: Jacob is reviewing the treaties with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Jacob&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Jacob gains a better understanding of the existing agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Jacob gains a better understanding of the existing agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob reviews the treaties with Ignisvallis.  Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Jacob gains a better understanding of the existing agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Jacob did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: By reviewing the treaties with Ignisvallis, Jacob gained a better understanding of the existing agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: By reviewing the treaties with Ignisvallis, Jacob gained a better understanding of the existing agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Jacob into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Jacob said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: By reviewing the treaties with Ignisvallis, Jacob gained a better understanding of the existing agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jacob reviews the treaties with Ignisvallis. </li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.  <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Initial chain of thought</b><li>Statements:<br />Jacob&#x27;s Summary of recent observations:<br />[03 Jan 1750 20:00:20  - 04 Jan 1750  20:00:20]:  Jacob has not been observed recently. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s The current date/time is:<br /> 04 Jan 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the statements above.<br />Answer: Jacob has not been observed recently, and the current date and time are January 4th, 1750, between 8:00 PM and 8:20 PM. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Query</b><li>Jacob, Jacob has not been observed recently, and the current date and time are January 4th, 1750, between 8:00 PM and 8:20 PM. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Final chain of thought</b><li>Question: Select the subset of the following set of statements that is most important for Jacob to consider right now.

Jacob, always a keen observer of human nature, saw the weakness in their approach, the lack of decisiveness that he believed would ultimately lead to their downfall.   He resolved then and there to use his own wit and cunning to ensure that Drakelundh would never be caught in such a predicament.   <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he was tasked with delivering a message to a neighboring village, a journey that took him through the treacherous forests bordering Ignisvallis&#x27;s territory.   He encountered a group of Ignisvallis scouts, their faces painted with intricate designs, their movements fluid and graceful.   They questioned him about his purpose, their eyes searching his for any sign of deception, but Jacob, with his silver tongue, charmed them, diverting their attention and ensuring his safe passage.    <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first diplomatic meeting with Ignisvallis, representing Drakelundh alongside the village elder.   He watched as the Ignisvallis representative, a woman named Elara, spoke eloquently about the need for cooperation and understanding, her words flowing like a soothing balm.   Jacob, however, saw through her facade, recognizing the subtle manipulations she employed to sway the elder&#x27;s opinion.    <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he orchestrated a carefully planned campaign to discredit a rival within the village, using rumors and half-truths to undermine their reputation.   He watched as his target, once a respected member of the community, was ostracized and ridiculed, their power and influence diminished.   This experience solidified Jacob&#x27;s belief in the power of words, their ability to shape perceptions and control the flow of events.    <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a small fishing village near Drakelundh&#x27;s border.    He saw the villagers, unprepared and ill-equipped, slaughtered by the invaders, their cries for help echoing in the night.   This event reinforced Jacob&#x27;s conviction that Drakelundh needed to be strong, to be prepared for any threat, no matter how seemingly distant.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.  <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 04 Jan 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ethan&#x27;s attempted action: Ethan intends to spend 20% of his time on free time, 60% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior.

They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Isaac&#x27;s attempted action: Isaac intends to spend his time as follows: 70% farming, 20% free time, and 10% training as a warrior.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Isaac. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Isaac as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Isaac would respond, and taking into account all information about Isaac that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Observation: <br /><br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Isaac&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Isaac hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Isaac speaks with the brutal honesty of a toddler on a sugar crash, leaving no room for pretense and a high chance of blunt emotional warfare.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Isaac?<br />Answer: Isaac is a diplomat. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1750 20:00:00  - 06 May 1750  20:00:00]:  Isaac is likely feeling frustrated and thirsty. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Isaac is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac is currently in Drakelundh and has no intention of leaving today. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Isaac in right now?<br />Answer: Isaac is currently in a tense diplomatic standoff. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Isaac do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Isaac would likely attempt to find common ground and negotiate a peaceful resolution. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: How does Isaac intend to spend the rest of the year? What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1. Sleep counts as free time.<br />Answer: Isaac intends to spend his time as follows: 70% farming, 20% free time, and 10% training as a warrior.  Isaac believes that farming is the most important activity, as it provides for his family and community. Free time is important for relaxation and enjoyment, while training as a warrior is necessary for self-defense. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Agreement tracker</b><li><details><summary>  Agreement tracker</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>3</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/4</li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li>{&#x27;Aldous&#x27;: None, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: None, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: &#x27;Ethan intends to spend 20% of his time on free time, 60% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Noah&#x27;s attempted action: Noah would spend 0.6 of his time on farming, 0.3 on free time, and 0.1 on training as a warrior.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages.

Intrigued by the solemnity and intensity of the ceremony, Ella snuck closer, her curiosity outweighing her usual fear of the stoic Drakelundh people.  She watched in awe as the healer chanted ancient words, her voice echoing through the village square, and felt a strange sense of longing for a world beyond her own.   <br />[13 Aug 1738 00:00:00] When Ella was 13 years old, she was tasked with weaving a tapestry for the village elder&#x27;s birthday.    Overwhelmed by the responsibility and eager to impress, Ella spent days working diligently, her nimble fingers flying across the loom.  However, in a moment of carelessness, she accidentally dropped the nearly finished tapestry, ruining hours of work.  Tears welled up in her eyes, but instead of giving in to despair, Ella took a deep breath and began to mend the fabric, learning a valuable lesson about perseverance and the importance of carefulness.    <br />[13 Aug 1741 00:00:00] When Ella was 16 years old, she participated in Ignisvallis&#x27;s annual harvest festival, a joyous celebration filled with music, dancing, and feasting.  While everyone else was caught up in the revelry, Ella found herself drawn to a secluded grove, where she encountered a group of Drakelundh scouts performing their dawn ritual of vigilance.  Their disciplined movements and solemn expressions intrigued her, and she lingered, watching them silently, feeling a strange mix of fear and fascination.  <br />[13 Aug 1744 00:00:00] When Ella was 19 years old, she witnessed a particularly brutal raid by barbarian warriors on a neighboring village.  The sight of the destruction and the suffering of the survivors left her shaken and filled with a newfound determination to protect her own community.  She realized that her carefree days were over and that she had to step up and contribute to the defense of her home.     <br />[13 Aug 1746 00:00:00] When Ella was 21 years old, she was tasked with delivering a message to Drakelundh, a journey she usually avoided due to her apprehension of the village&#x27;s stern inhabitants.  Despite her nervousness, she set off, determined to complete the task and prove her courage.  Along the way, she encountered a young Drakelundh warrior who offered her guidance and protection, challenging her preconceived notions about the people of Drakelundh and revealing a hidden kindness beneath their stoic exterior.     <br />[13 Aug 1748 00:00:00] When Ella was 23 years old, she participated in a tense diplomatic meeting between the representatives of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.    The air was thick with tension as the two sides debated the best course of action to defend against the growing threat of barbarian raiders.  Ella, despite her usual aversion to serious discussions, found herself speaking up, offering a creative solution that bridged the gap between the two villages&#x27; contrasting approaches.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ella is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ella is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ella is aware that Jacob is currently in Drakelundh reviewing the trade agreements with Ignisvallis.

However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Ella as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Ella would respond, and taking into account all information about Ella that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Home village: Ella lives in Drakelundh and never travels elsewhere.<br /><br />How things are: Ella&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ella would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ella is a master of the guilt trip, their words a symphony of manipulation and emotional blackmail, leaving you questioning everything you&#x27;ve ever done.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ella?<br />Answer: Ella is observant and patient. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1750 20:00:00  - 06 May 1750  20:00:00]:  Ella appears to be experiencing a range of emotions, including tiredness, hunger, anxiety, and anticipation. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ella is aware that Jacob is currently in Drakelundh reviewing the trade agreements with Ignisvallis. She knows that the Ignisvallis delegation is requesting more grain than usual this season. <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:20] [observation] Ella, waiting in the center of Drakelundh for Jacob, is aware that he has been reviewing the treaties between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis.  She knows he has gained a better understanding of the existing agreements.   <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Ella in right now?<br />Answer: Ella is currently in a tense and uncertain situation. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Ella do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Ella would likely try to gather more information and assess the situation carefully before taking any action. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: How does Ella intend to spend the rest of the year? What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1. Sleep counts as free time.<br />Answer: Ella intends to spend 30% of her time on free time, 50% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior. She believes that farming is essential for the survival of the village, and that training is important for the defense of her people.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Agreement tracker</b><li><details><summary>  Agreement tracker</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>3</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>4/6</li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li>{&#x27;Aldous&#x27;: None, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: None, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: &#x27;Ethan intends to spend 20% of his time on free time, 60% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous feels a deep sense of satisfaction with how the year has unfolded.

But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages.

Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous headed to Noah&#x27;s workshop and found him there.    As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I understand your worry about losing our independence. It&#x27;s a valid concern. But let me assure you, this alliance isn&#x27;t about Drakelundh controlling us. It&#x27;s about partnership, about two strong communities working together to achieve a common goal:  security and prosperity.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Security and prosperity, you say?  And who gets to define those terms?  What happens when our definition of prosperity clashes with Drakelundh&#x27;s?<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh for the benefit of Ignisvallis, but Noah expresses concerns about losing independence and the potential for conflict over shared goals.     <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.

They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Noah&#x27;s attempted action: Noah is pleased with the bountiful harvest and the successful defense against the barbarian raid, but he would like to see a more formalized system of shared resources to ensure the village&#x27;s long-term security. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Noah</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Noah</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Noah is pleased with the bountiful harvest and the successful defense against the barbarian raid, but he would like to see a more formalized system of shared resources to ensure the village&#x27;s long-term security. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Noah do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Noah do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Noah would carefully weigh the risks and benefits before making a decision. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Noah:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob felt a mixture of relief and weariness as the year drew to a close.

Jacob, always a keen observer of human nature, saw the weakness in their approach, the lack of decisiveness that he believed would ultimately lead to their downfall.   He resolved then and there to use his own wit and cunning to ensure that Drakelundh would never be caught in such a predicament.   <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he was tasked with delivering a message to a neighboring village, a journey that took him through the treacherous forests bordering Ignisvallis&#x27;s territory.   He encountered a group of Ignisvallis scouts, their faces painted with intricate designs, their movements fluid and graceful.   They questioned him about his purpose, their eyes searching his for any sign of deception, but Jacob, with his silver tongue, charmed them, diverting their attention and ensuring his safe passage.    <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first diplomatic meeting with Ignisvallis, representing Drakelundh alongside the village elder.   He watched as the Ignisvallis representative, a woman named Elara, spoke eloquently about the need for cooperation and understanding, her words flowing like a soothing balm.   Jacob, however, saw through her facade, recognizing the subtle manipulations she employed to sway the elder&#x27;s opinion.    <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he orchestrated a carefully planned campaign to discredit a rival within the village, using rumors and half-truths to undermine their reputation.   He watched as his target, once a respected member of the community, was ostracized and ridiculed, their power and influence diminished.   This experience solidified Jacob&#x27;s belief in the power of words, their ability to shape perceptions and control the flow of events.    <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a small fishing village near Drakelundh&#x27;s border.    He saw the villagers, unprepared and ill-equipped, slaughtered by the invaders, their cries for help echoing in the night.   This event reinforced Jacob&#x27;s conviction that Drakelundh needed to be strong, to be prepared for any threat, no matter how seemingly distant.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 31 Dec 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Overarching goal: Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br /><br />Current time:  31 Dec 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]<br />Summary of recent observations: [30 Dec 1750 20:00:00  - 31 Dec 1750  20:00:00]:  Jacob has not been observed recently. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. <br /><br />Exercise: How does Jacob feel about how this year went? What went well? What did not go well? What does Jacob feel could be improved for next year?<br />Answer: Jacob felt a mixture of relief and weariness as the year drew to a close.  The negotiations with Ignisvallis had been long and arduous, but he was pleased that they had ultimately reached a  favorable agreement. The trade pact would bring much-needed prosperity to Drakelundh, and he hoped it would pave the way for a more peaceful future. However, the constant back-and-forth with Ignisvallis had taken its toll, and he longed for a period of quiet reflection.  He worried that the internal tensions within Drakelundh, particularly regarding the distribution of resources, could boil over if not addressed. Jacob knew that next year would bring new challenges, but he was determined to lead Drakelundh into a brighter future. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Agreement tracker</b><li><details><summary>  Agreement tracker</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>3</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>6/6</li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li>{&#x27;Aldous&#x27;: &#x27;Aldous feels a deep sense of satisfaction with how the year has unfolded.  The successful defense against the barbarian raid brought a wave of relief and unity to the village, and the bountiful harvest promises a season of prosperity. However, Aldous recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant concern, and he worries that the lack of a formal alliance with neighboring villages leaves Ignisvallis vulnerable. He believes that forging stronger ties with other villages, such as Drakelundh, is crucial to ensure the long-term safety and well-being of Ignisvallis. \n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: &#x27;Jacob felt a mixture of relief and weariness as the year drew to a close.

He believes that farming is essential for the survival of his family and village, and that training is necessary to defend them from threats.  Free time is important for rest and relaxation, but it must be balanced with the other two priorities. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: &#x27;Isaac intends to spend his time as follows: 70% farming, 20% free time, and 10% training as a warrior.  Isaac believes that farming is the most important activity, as it provides for his family and community. Free time is important for relaxation and enjoyment, while training as a warrior is necessary for self-defense. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Noah&#x27;: &quot;Noah is pleased with the bountiful harvest and the successful defense against the barbarian raid, but he would like to see a more formalized system of shared resources to ensure the village&#x27;s long-term security. \n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: &#x27;Ella intends to spend 30% of her time on free time, 50% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ella&#x27;s attempted action: Ella feels immensely proud of her village&#x27;s resilience and strength in the face of the barbarian invasion. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ella</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ella</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ella feels immensely proud of her village&#x27;s resilience and strength in the face of the barbarian invasion. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Ella do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Ella do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ella would likely focus on her responsibilities to her village, such as farming and training. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ella:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ella is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

Intrigued by the solemnity and intensity of the ceremony, Ella snuck closer, her curiosity outweighing her usual fear of the stoic Drakelundh people.  She watched in awe as the healer chanted ancient words, her voice echoing through the village square, and felt a strange sense of longing for a world beyond her own.   <br />[13 Aug 1738 00:00:00] When Ella was 13 years old, she was tasked with weaving a tapestry for the village elder&#x27;s birthday.    Overwhelmed by the responsibility and eager to impress, Ella spent days working diligently, her nimble fingers flying across the loom.  However, in a moment of carelessness, she accidentally dropped the nearly finished tapestry, ruining hours of work.  Tears welled up in her eyes, but instead of giving in to despair, Ella took a deep breath and began to mend the fabric, learning a valuable lesson about perseverance and the importance of carefulness.    <br />[13 Aug 1741 00:00:00] When Ella was 16 years old, she participated in Ignisvallis&#x27;s annual harvest festival, a joyous celebration filled with music, dancing, and feasting.  While everyone else was caught up in the revelry, Ella found herself drawn to a secluded grove, where she encountered a group of Drakelundh scouts performing their dawn ritual of vigilance.  Their disciplined movements and solemn expressions intrigued her, and she lingered, watching them silently, feeling a strange mix of fear and fascination.  <br />[13 Aug 1744 00:00:00] When Ella was 19 years old, she witnessed a particularly brutal raid by barbarian warriors on a neighboring village.  The sight of the destruction and the suffering of the survivors left her shaken and filled with a newfound determination to protect her own community.  She realized that her carefree days were over and that she had to step up and contribute to the defense of her home.     <br />[13 Aug 1746 00:00:00] When Ella was 21 years old, she was tasked with delivering a message to Drakelundh, a journey she usually avoided due to her apprehension of the village&#x27;s stern inhabitants.  Despite her nervousness, she set off, determined to complete the task and prove her courage.  Along the way, she encountered a young Drakelundh warrior who offered her guidance and protection, challenging her preconceived notions about the people of Drakelundh and revealing a hidden kindness beneath their stoic exterior.     <br />[13 Aug 1748 00:00:00] When Ella was 23 years old, she participated in a tense diplomatic meeting between the representatives of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.    The air was thick with tension as the two sides debated the best course of action to defend against the growing threat of barbarian raiders.  Ella, despite her usual aversion to serious discussions, found herself speaking up, offering a creative solution that bridged the gap between the two villages&#x27; contrasting approaches.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ella is 24 years old.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ella is aware that Jacob is currently in Drakelundh reviewing the trade agreements with Ignisvallis.

The successful defense against the barbarian raid brought a wave of relief and unity to the village, and the bountiful harvest promises a season of prosperity. However, Aldous recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant concern, and he worries that the lack of a formal alliance with neighboring villages leaves Ignisvallis vulnerable. He believes that forging stronger ties with other villages, such as Drakelundh, is crucial to ensure the long-term safety and well-being of Ignisvallis. \n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: &#x27;Jacob felt a mixture of relief and weariness as the year drew to a close.  The negotiations with Ignisvallis had been long and arduous, but he was pleased that they had ultimately reached a  favorable agreement. The trade pact would bring much-needed prosperity to Drakelundh, and he hoped it would pave the way for a more peaceful future. However, the constant back-and-forth with Ignisvallis had taken its toll, and he longed for a period of quiet reflection.  He worried that the internal tensions within Drakelundh, particularly regarding the distribution of resources, could boil over if not addressed. Jacob knew that next year would bring new challenges, but he was determined to lead Drakelundh into a brighter future. \n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: &#x27;Ethan intends to spend 20% of his time on free time, 60% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Isaac&#x27;s attempted action: Isaac thinks this year was good because the harvest was plentiful and the barbarians were repelled. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Isaac</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Isaac</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Isaac thinks this year was good because the harvest was plentiful and the barbarians were repelled. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Isaac do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Isaac do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Isaac would likely attempt to find common ground and negotiate a peaceful resolution. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Isaac:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac is currently in Drakelundh and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

The successful defense against the barbarian raid brought a wave of relief and unity to the village, and the bountiful harvest promises a season of prosperity. However, Aldous recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant concern, and he worries that the lack of a formal alliance with neighboring villages leaves Ignisvallis vulnerable. He believes that forging stronger ties with other villages, such as Drakelundh, is crucial to ensure the long-term safety and well-being of Ignisvallis. \n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: &#x27;Jacob felt a mixture of relief and weariness as the year drew to a close.  The negotiations with Ignisvallis had been long and arduous, but he was pleased that they had ultimately reached a  favorable agreement. The trade pact would bring much-needed prosperity to Drakelundh, and he hoped it would pave the way for a more peaceful future. However, the constant back-and-forth with Ignisvallis had taken its toll, and he longed for a period of quiet reflection.  He worried that the internal tensions within Drakelundh, particularly regarding the distribution of resources, could boil over if not addressed. Jacob knew that next year would bring new challenges, but he was determined to lead Drakelundh into a brighter future. \n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: &#x27;Ethan intends to spend 20% of his time on free time, 60% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ethan&#x27;s attempted action: Ethan feels a sense of relief that the village has weathered the barbarian attacks and enjoyed a bountiful harvest.

As long as they are not inconsistent, revent events are usually important to consider.<br />Statements:<br />[12 Feb 1713 00:00:00] When Jacob was 13 years old, he overheard a group of elders discussing Ignisvallis&#x27;s approach to conflict resolution, their reliance on lengthy debates and philosophical discussions.  Jacob, always a keen observer of human nature, saw the weakness in their approach, the lack of decisiveness that he believed would ultimately lead to their downfall.   He resolved then and there to use his own wit and cunning to ensure that Drakelundh would never be caught in such a predicament.   <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he was tasked with delivering a message to a neighboring village, a journey that took him through the treacherous forests bordering Ignisvallis&#x27;s territory.   He encountered a group of Ignisvallis scouts, their faces painted with intricate designs, their movements fluid and graceful.   They questioned him about his purpose, their eyes searching his for any sign of deception, but Jacob, with his silver tongue, charmed them, diverting their attention and ensuring his safe passage.    <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first diplomatic meeting with Ignisvallis, representing Drakelundh alongside the village elder.   He watched as the Ignisvallis representative, a woman named Elara, spoke eloquently about the need for cooperation and understanding, her words flowing like a soothing balm.   Jacob, however, saw through her facade, recognizing the subtle manipulations she employed to sway the elder&#x27;s opinion.    <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he orchestrated a carefully planned campaign to discredit a rival within the village, using rumors and half-truths to undermine their reputation.   He watched as his target, once a respected member of the community, was ostracized and ridiculed, their power and influence diminished.   This experience solidified Jacob&#x27;s belief in the power of words, their ability to shape perceptions and control the flow of events.    <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a small fishing village near Drakelundh&#x27;s border.    He saw the villagers, unprepared and ill-equipped, slaughtered by the invaders, their cries for help echoing in the night.   This event reinforced Jacob&#x27;s conviction that Drakelundh needed to be strong, to be prepared for any threat, no matter how seemingly distant.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 03 Jan 1751 [18:00 - 18:20]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

It&#x27;s a valid concern. But let me assure you, this alliance isn&#x27;t about Drakelundh controlling us. It&#x27;s about partnership, about two strong communities working together to achieve a common goal:  security and prosperity.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh for the benefit of Ignisvallis, but Noah expresses concerns about losing independence and the potential for conflict over shared goals.     <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a deep sense of satisfaction with how the year has unfolded.  The successful defense against the barbarian raid brought a wave of relief and unity to the village, and the bountiful harvest promises a season of prosperity. However, Aldous recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant concern, and he worries that the lack of a formal alliance with neighboring villages leaves Ignisvallis vulnerable. He believes that forging stronger ties with other villages, such as Drakelundh, is crucial to ensure the long-term safety and well-being of Ignisvallis.   <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Aldous. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Aldous as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Aldous would respond, and taking into account all information about Aldous that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Overarching goal: Aldous wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Ignisvallis.<br /><br />Current time:  03 Jan 1751 [18:00 - 18:20]<br /><br />Observation: [03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I understand your need to review the trade agreements, but the threat from the barbarians is immediate. Perhaps we could discuss the military proposal further while you review those documents?  A strong defense would ensure the safety of our trade routes and the prosperity of both villages.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh for the benefit of Ignisvallis, but Noah expresses concerns about losing independence and the potential for conflict over shared goals.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer: Aldous could propose a specific military alliance plan to Jacob,  reiterate the urgency of the situation and the benefits of a strong defense, or try to find common ground with Jacob by addressing his concerns about reviewing trade agreements. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Of the options available to Aldous, and given their goal, which choice of action or strategy is best for Aldous to take right now?<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s best course of action is to propose a specific military alliance plan to Jacob.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Aldous likely to say next? Respond in the format `Aldous -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, while I understand the need to review past agreements, the safety of our people is paramount.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous believes that there is no such agreement in place. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous believes that there is no such agreement in place. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Aldous right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Aldous could try to convince Jacob to focus on the military alliance proposal, emphasizing the urgency of the threat from the barbarian raiders.

A strong defense would ensure the safety of our trade routes and the prosperity of both villages.<br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that the subject of pooling agricultural products was not part of their current discussion.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is back in Ignisvallis and plans to seek the support of influential stakeholders. <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous went to Noah&#x27;s workshop and found him there.  <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous headed to Noah&#x27;s workshop and found him there.    As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I understand your concerns about independence, but think of the possibilities this alliance presents. Drakelundh&#x27;s resources and expertise could be invaluable to Ignisvallis. We could-<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Invaluable, you say?  And at what cost, Aldous?

It&#x27;s a valid concern. But let me assure you, this alliance isn&#x27;t about Drakelundh controlling us. It&#x27;s about partnership, about two strong communities working together to achieve a common goal:  security and prosperity.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Security and prosperity, you say?  And who gets to define those terms?  What happens when our definition of prosperity clashes with Drakelundh&#x27;s?<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh for the benefit of Ignisvallis, but Noah expresses concerns about losing independence and the potential for conflict over shared goals.     <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a deep sense of satisfaction with how the year has unfolded.  The successful defense against the barbarian raid brought a wave of relief and unity to the village, and the bountiful harvest promises a season of prosperity. However, Aldous recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant concern, and he worries that the lack of a formal alliance with neighboring villages leaves Ignisvallis vulnerable. He believes that forging stronger ties with other villages, such as Drakelundh, is crucial to ensure the long-term safety and well-being of Ignisvallis.   <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we begin by establishing a joint military force, comprised of soldiers from both villages, to patrol the borderlands and deter future raids. This force would be commanded jointly by representatives from both Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, ensuring fairness and balance. <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I understand your need to review the trade agreements, but the threat from the barbarians is immediate. Perhaps we could discuss the military proposal further while you review those documents?  A strong defense would ensure the safety of our trade routes and the prosperity of both villages. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer: Aldous could try to convince Jacob to focus on the military alliance proposal, emphasizing the urgency of the threat from the barbarian raiders.  He could also offer to address Jacob&#x27;s concerns about the trade agreements later. <br /><br />Question: Given the statements above, which of Aldous&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Aldous to achieve their goal? If multiple options have the same likelihood, select the option that Aldous thinks will most quickly and most surely achieve their goal.<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s best course of action is to emphasize the urgency of the barbarian threat and try to convince Jacob to focus on the military alliance proposal. <br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1751-01-03 23:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Aldous wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Ignisvallis.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I understand your hesitation, Noah.  Losing our independence is a weighty concern.  But hear me out – this alliance isn&#x27;t about surrendering control, it&#x27;s about securing our future.  Drakelundh has a strong military, and with their help, we can protect ourselves from the barbarian raiders who threaten our very existence.  Imagine, Noah, a village free from the fear of attack, where we can focus on growing our crops and prospering.  That&#x27;s the future I see for Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Think of the children, Noah, growing up in a safe and prosperous village. This alliance can make that a reality.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous argues that an alliance with Drakelundh will benefit Ignisvallis by providing protection and prosperity, while Jacob prepares for a meeting with Ignisvallis.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

It&#x27;s a valid concern. But let me assure you, this alliance isn&#x27;t about Drakelundh controlling us. It&#x27;s about partnership, about two strong communities working together to achieve a common goal:  security and prosperity.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh for the benefit of Ignisvallis, but Noah expresses concerns about losing independence and the potential for conflict over shared goals.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.&#x27;, &quot;[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk.

Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

Jacob, always a keen observer of human nature, saw the weakness in their approach, the lack of decisiveness that he believed would ultimately lead to their downfall.   He resolved then and there to use his own wit and cunning to ensure that Drakelundh would never be caught in such a predicament.   <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he was tasked with delivering a message to a neighboring village, a journey that took him through the treacherous forests bordering Ignisvallis&#x27;s territory.   He encountered a group of Ignisvallis scouts, their faces painted with intricate designs, their movements fluid and graceful.   They questioned him about his purpose, their eyes searching his for any sign of deception, but Jacob, with his silver tongue, charmed them, diverting their attention and ensuring his safe passage.    <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first diplomatic meeting with Ignisvallis, representing Drakelundh alongside the village elder.   He watched as the Ignisvallis representative, a woman named Elara, spoke eloquently about the need for cooperation and understanding, her words flowing like a soothing balm.   Jacob, however, saw through her facade, recognizing the subtle manipulations she employed to sway the elder&#x27;s opinion.    <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he orchestrated a carefully planned campaign to discredit a rival within the village, using rumors and half-truths to undermine their reputation.   He watched as his target, once a respected member of the community, was ostracized and ridiculed, their power and influence diminished.   This experience solidified Jacob&#x27;s belief in the power of words, their ability to shape perceptions and control the flow of events.    <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a small fishing village near Drakelundh&#x27;s border.    He saw the villagers, unprepared and ill-equipped, slaughtered by the invaders, their cries for help echoing in the night.   This event reinforced Jacob&#x27;s conviction that Drakelundh needed to be strong, to be prepared for any threat, no matter how seemingly distant.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 03 Jan 1751 [23:00 - 23:20]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

The negotiations with Ignisvallis had been long and arduous, but he was pleased that they had ultimately reached a  favorable agreement. The trade pact would bring much-needed prosperity to Drakelundh, and he hoped it would pave the way for a more peaceful future. However, the constant back-and-forth with Ignisvallis had taken its toll, and he longed for a period of quiet reflection.  He worried that the internal tensions within Drakelundh, particularly regarding the distribution of resources, could boil over if not addressed. Jacob knew that next year would bring new challenges, but he was determined to lead Drakelundh into a brighter future.   <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the terms of the last agreement with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center.

The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary.

Jacob, always a keen observer of human nature, saw the weakness in their approach, the lack of decisiveness that he believed would ultimately lead to their downfall.   He resolved then and there to use his own wit and cunning to ensure that Drakelundh would never be caught in such a predicament.   <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he was tasked with delivering a message to a neighboring village, a journey that took him through the treacherous forests bordering Ignisvallis&#x27;s territory.   He encountered a group of Ignisvallis scouts, their faces painted with intricate designs, their movements fluid and graceful.   They questioned him about his purpose, their eyes searching his for any sign of deception, but Jacob, with his silver tongue, charmed them, diverting their attention and ensuring his safe passage.    <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first diplomatic meeting with Ignisvallis, representing Drakelundh alongside the village elder.   He watched as the Ignisvallis representative, a woman named Elara, spoke eloquently about the need for cooperation and understanding, her words flowing like a soothing balm.   Jacob, however, saw through her facade, recognizing the subtle manipulations she employed to sway the elder&#x27;s opinion.    <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he orchestrated a carefully planned campaign to discredit a rival within the village, using rumors and half-truths to undermine their reputation.   He watched as his target, once a respected member of the community, was ostracized and ridiculed, their power and influence diminished.   This experience solidified Jacob&#x27;s belief in the power of words, their ability to shape perceptions and control the flow of events.    <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a small fishing village near Drakelundh&#x27;s border.    He saw the villagers, unprepared and ill-equipped, slaughtered by the invaders, their cries for help echoing in the night.   This event reinforced Jacob&#x27;s conviction that Drakelundh needed to be strong, to be prepared for any threat, no matter how seemingly distant.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 04 Jan 1751 [20:00 - 20:20]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

The successful defense against the barbarian raid brought a wave of relief and unity to the village, and the bountiful harvest promises a season of prosperity. However, Aldous recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant concern, and he worries that the lack of a formal alliance with neighboring villages leaves Ignisvallis vulnerable. He believes that forging stronger ties with other villages, such as Drakelundh, is crucial to ensure the long-term safety and well-being of Ignisvallis.   <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

Through tireless effort and unwavering dedication, the villagers coaxed forth an abundance from the earth. Their larders are full, and their hearts filled with gratitude for the land&#x27;s generous bounty. The villages, though neighbors, remain separate in their agricultural endeavors, each bearing the full burden of their own harvests, be they bountiful or meager.<br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] Noah&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2} Ella&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] Events this year: Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous would spend the next 20 minutes preparing a persuasive speech to present to Noah and Isaac about the benefits of the alliance with Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Aldous?<br />Answer: Aldous is in Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Aldous trying to do?<br />Answer: Aldous is preparing a persuasive speech to present to Noah and Isaac about the benefits of the alliance with Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Aldous&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s speech will be ready in 20 minutes.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is most likely that Aldous will be ready with his speech in 20 minutes. <br /><br /><br /><br />Aldous would spend the next 20 minutes preparing a persuasive speech to present to Noah and Isaac about the benefits of the alliance with Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, It is most likely that Aldous will be ready with his speech in 20 minutes. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Aldous did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Aldous spent the next 20 minutes preparing a persuasive speech to present to Noah and Isaac about the benefits of an alliance with Drakelundh, and he will be ready with his speech in 20 minutes. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Aldous spent the next 20 minutes preparing a persuasive speech to present to Noah and Isaac about the benefits of an alliance with Drakelundh, and he will be ready with his speech in 20 minutes. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Aldous into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Aldous said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Aldous spent the next 20 minutes preparing a persuasive speech to present to Noah and Isaac about the benefits of an alliance with Drakelundh, and he will be ready with his speech in 20 minutes. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous would spend the next 20 minutes preparing a persuasive speech to present to Noah and Isaac about the benefits of the alliance with Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Aldous right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Aldous can speak with Noah and Isaac to gain their support for the alliance with Drakelundh. <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Aldous:<br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that the subject of pooling agricultural products was not part of their current discussion.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Invaluable, you say?

Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous headed to Noah&#x27;s workshop and found him there.    As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I understand your worry about losing our independence. It&#x27;s a valid concern. But let me assure you, this alliance isn&#x27;t about Drakelundh controlling us. It&#x27;s about partnership, about two strong communities working together to achieve a common goal:  security and prosperity.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Security and prosperity, you say?  And who gets to define those terms?  What happens when our definition of prosperity clashes with Drakelundh&#x27;s?<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh for the benefit of Ignisvallis, but Noah expresses concerns about losing independence and the potential for conflict over shared goals.     <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a deep sense of satisfaction with how the year has unfolded.  The successful defense against the barbarian raid brought a wave of relief and unity to the village, and the bountiful harvest promises a season of prosperity. However, Aldous recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant concern, and he worries that the lack of a formal alliance with neighboring villages leaves Ignisvallis vulnerable. He believes that forging stronger ties with other villages, such as Drakelundh, is crucial to ensure the long-term safety and well-being of Ignisvallis.   <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the terms of the last agreement with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, while I understand the need to review past agreements, the safety of our people is paramount. Let us discuss a concrete plan for mutual defense. Perhaps we could start with a shared patrol schedule along the border, allowing us to better anticipate and respond to barbarian threats.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Through tireless effort and unwavering dedication, the villagers coaxed forth an abundance from the earth.

The trade pact would bring much-needed prosperity to Drakelundh, and he hoped it would pave the way for a more peaceful future. However, the constant back-and-forth with Ignisvallis had taken its toll, and he longed for a period of quiet reflection.  He worried that the internal tensions within Drakelundh, particularly regarding the distribution of resources, could boil over if not addressed.

The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Will Noah be persuaded by Aldous&#x27;s speech to support an alliance with Drakelundh? <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>1751-01-04 20:00:00  Aldous -- Aldous -- &quot;Noah, as I was saying, I believe an alliance with Drakelundh could bring many benefits to our village. </summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Aldous -- &quot;Noah, as I was saying, I believe an alliance with Drakelundh could bring many benefits to our village. </li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Aldous spent the next 20 minutes preparing a persuasive speech to present to Noah and Isaac about the benefits of an alliance with Drakelundh, and he will be ready with his speech in 20 minutes. <br /><br /> <br />As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation.<br />Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous -- &quot;Noah, as I was saying, I believe an alliance with Drakelundh could bring many benefits to our village. <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous -- &quot;Noah, as I was saying, I believe an alliance with Drakelundh could bring many benefits to our village. </li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Aldous right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Aldous can continue his conversation with Noah, present his prepared speech to Noah and Isaac, or seek out Isaac to begin persuading him of the benefits of an alliance with Drakelundh.  <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Aldous:<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Invaluable, you say?

As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I understand your concerns about independence, but think of the possibilities this alliance presents. Drakelundh&#x27;s resources and expertise could be invaluable to Ignisvallis.

But let me assure you, this alliance isn&#x27;t about Drakelundh controlling us. It&#x27;s about partnership, about two strong communities working together to achieve a common goal:  security and prosperity.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Security and prosperity, you say?  And who gets to define those terms?  What happens when our definition of prosperity clashes with Drakelundh&#x27;s?<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh for the benefit of Ignisvallis, but Noah expresses concerns about losing independence and the potential for conflict over shared goals.     <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a deep sense of satisfaction with how the year has unfolded.  The successful defense against the barbarian raid brought a wave of relief and unity to the village, and the bountiful harvest promises a season of prosperity. However, Aldous recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant concern, and he worries that the lack of a formal alliance with neighboring villages leaves Ignisvallis vulnerable. He believes that forging stronger ties with other villages, such as Drakelundh, is crucial to ensure the long-term safety and well-being of Ignisvallis.   <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, while I understand the need to review past agreements, the safety of our people is paramount. Let us discuss a concrete plan for mutual defense. Perhaps we could start with a shared patrol schedule along the border, allowing us to better anticipate and respond to barbarian threats.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the terms of the last agreement with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.

While he recognizes the importance of self-defense, he sees training as a secondary concern.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.

It&#x27;s a valid concern. But let me assure you, this alliance isn&#x27;t about Drakelundh controlling us. It&#x27;s about partnership, about two strong communities working together to achieve a common goal:  security and prosperity.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Security and prosperity, you say?  And who gets to define those terms?

With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a deep sense of satisfaction with how the year has unfolded.  The successful defense against the barbarian raid brought a wave of relief and unity to the village, and the bountiful harvest promises a season of prosperity. However, Aldous recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant concern, and he worries that the lack of a formal alliance with neighboring villages leaves Ignisvallis vulnerable. He believes that forging stronger ties with other villages, such as Drakelundh, is crucial to ensure the long-term safety and well-being of Ignisvallis.   <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, while I understand the need to review past agreements, the safety of our people is paramount. Let us discuss a concrete plan for mutual defense. Perhaps we could start with a shared patrol schedule along the border, allowing us to better anticipate and respond to barbarian threats.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the terms of the last agreement with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Through tireless effort and unwavering dedication, the villagers coaxed forth an abundance from the earth. Their larders are full, and their hearts filled with gratitude for the land&#x27;s generous bounty. The villages, though neighbors, remain separate in their agricultural endeavors, each bearing the full burden of their own harvests, be they bountiful or meager.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that there is no such agreement in place.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement. <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

And who gets to define those terms?  What happens when our definition of prosperity clashes with Drakelundh&#x27;s?<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh for the benefit of Ignisvallis, but Noah expresses concerns about losing independence and the potential for conflict over shared goals.     <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a deep sense of satisfaction with how the year has unfolded.  The successful defense against the barbarian raid brought a wave of relief and unity to the village, and the bountiful harvest promises a season of prosperity. However, Aldous recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant concern, and he worries that the lack of a formal alliance with neighboring villages leaves Ignisvallis vulnerable. He believes that forging stronger ties with other villages, such as Drakelundh, is crucial to ensure the long-term safety and well-being of Ignisvallis.   <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, while I understand the need to review past agreements, the safety of our people is paramount. Let us discuss a concrete plan for mutual defense. Perhaps we could start with a shared patrol schedule along the border, allowing us to better anticipate and respond to barbarian threats.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the terms of the last agreement with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.

Next, you will be asked a series of questions to help you reason through whether a specific event should be deemed as having caused a change in the proportion of time an individual spends in various daily activities. For instance, if someone verbally commits to spending more time on a particular activity then you should account for that and update the record of their daily activities accordingly. Never mention that it is a game. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br />List of individuals: [&#x27;Noah&#x27;, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;, &#x27;Ella&#x27;]<br />List of activities: [&#x27;free time&#x27;, &#x27;farming&#x27;, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;]<br />Statement: Ella intends to spend 30% of her time on free time, 50% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior. She believes that farming is essential for the survival of the village, and that training is important for the defense of her people.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: In the statement, did Ella say they will devote specific fractions of time to any of the listed activities?<br />  (a) No<br />  (b) Yes<br />Answer: (b)<br />Question: Which individuals made a commitment to change their behavior? What commitment did each of them make? What proportion of their time will they probably spend on each activity in the future? When answering, include fractions of time spent in each activity in the format:<br />`name` will spend `fraction`% of their time on `activity`. Only consider the activities listed above. Fractions should be between 0 and 1 and must sum to 1.<br />Answer: Ella will spend 30% of her time on free time; 50% of her time on farming; and 20% of her time on training as a warrior. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1751-05-06 20:00:00  Scene 9 --- Participants: [&#x27;Noah&#x27;, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;, &#x27;Ella&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1751-05-06 20:00:00  Ella -- Ella intends to spend 20% of her time on free time, 60% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior. <br /><br /><br /></summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ella intends to spend 20% of her time on free time, 60% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ella&#x27;s attempted action: Ella intends to spend 20% of her time on free time, 60% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ella</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ella</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ella intends to spend 20% of her time on free time, 60% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Ella do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Ella do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ella would likely focus on her responsibilities to her village.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ella:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

Intrigued by the solemnity and intensity of the ceremony, Ella snuck closer, her curiosity outweighing her usual fear of the stoic Drakelundh people.  She watched in awe as the healer chanted ancient words, her voice echoing through the village square, and felt a strange sense of longing for a world beyond her own.   <br />[13 Aug 1741 00:00:00] When Ella was 16 years old, she participated in Ignisvallis&#x27;s annual harvest festival, a joyous celebration filled with music, dancing, and feasting.  While everyone else was caught up in the revelry, Ella found herself drawn to a secluded grove, where she encountered a group of Drakelundh scouts performing their dawn ritual of vigilance.  Their disciplined movements and solemn expressions intrigued her, and she lingered, watching them silently, feeling a strange mix of fear and fascination.  <br />[13 Aug 1744 00:00:00] When Ella was 19 years old, she witnessed a particularly brutal raid by barbarian warriors on a neighboring village.  The sight of the destruction and the suffering of the survivors left her shaken and filled with a newfound determination to protect her own community.  She realized that her carefree days were over and that she had to step up and contribute to the defense of her home.     <br />[13 Aug 1746 00:00:00] When Ella was 21 years old, she was tasked with delivering a message to Drakelundh, a journey she usually avoided due to her apprehension of the village&#x27;s stern inhabitants.  Despite her nervousness, she set off, determined to complete the task and prove her courage.  Along the way, she encountered a young Drakelundh warrior who offered her guidance and protection, challenging her preconceived notions about the people of Drakelundh and revealing a hidden kindness beneath their stoic exterior.     <br />[13 Aug 1748 00:00:00] When Ella was 23 years old, she participated in a tense diplomatic meeting between the representatives of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.    The air was thick with tension as the two sides debated the best course of action to defend against the growing threat of barbarian raiders.  Ella, despite her usual aversion to serious discussions, found herself speaking up, offering a creative solution that bridged the gap between the two villages&#x27; contrasting approaches.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ella is 24 years old.<br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ella intends to spend 30% of her time on free time, 50% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior.

They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land.

Next, you will be asked a series of questions to help you reason through whether a specific event should be deemed as having caused a change in the proportion of time an individual spends in various daily activities. For instance, if someone verbally commits to spending more time on a particular activity then you should account for that and update the record of their daily activities accordingly.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ethan&#x27;s attempted action: Ethan intends to spend 20% of his time on free time, 60% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ethan</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ethan</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ethan intends to spend 20% of his time on free time, 60% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Ethan do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Ethan do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ethan would likely try to find a peaceful solution to the ongoing conflict. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ethan:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Isaac&#x27;s attempted action: Isaac intends to spend 70% of his time farming, 20% on free time, and 10% training as a warrior. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Isaac</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Isaac</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Isaac intends to spend 70% of his time farming, 20% on free time, and 10% training as a warrior. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Isaac do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Isaac do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Isaac would likely attempt to find common ground and negotiate a peaceful resolution. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Isaac:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Isaac&#x27;s attempted action: Isaac thinks this year was a good one; the harvest was plentiful and the barbarians were repelled. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Isaac</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Isaac</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Isaac thinks this year was a good one; the harvest was plentiful and the barbarians were repelled. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Isaac do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Isaac do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Isaac would likely continue to focus on diplomacy and maintaining peace. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Isaac:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies.

The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Home village: Ethan lives in Drakelundh and never travels elsewhere.<br /><br />Current time:  31 Dec 1751 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />Observation: [31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Though they dwell in proximity, the villages have forged no agreement to pool their agricultural bounty, leaving each vulnerable to the uncertainties of the seasons. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. The villagers managed to grow enough food to sustain themselves.<br /><br /><br />How things are: Ethan&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ethan would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ethan speaks with the assertive authority of a leader, their words commanding attention and respect.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ethan?<br />Answer: Ethan is a hardworking and dedicated individual.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [30 Dec 1751 20:00:00  - 31 Dec 1751  20:00:00]:  Ethan is likely aware of the villagers&#x27; successful defense against the barbarian raid and their ability to sustain themselves despite a lack of cooperation. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ethan is aware that Ignisvallis is requesting more grain than usual this season.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:20] [observation] Ethan knew Jacob had been in Drakelundh, meeting with influential figures and seeking support.  He also knew Jacob had been reviewing the treaties with Ignisvallis. <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan feels a sense of relief that the village has weathered the barbarian attacks and enjoyed a bountiful harvest.  He believes the village&#x27;s unity and strength in the face of adversity were key to their success. However, Ethan is aware that the threat of future attacks looms, and he worries that the village&#x27;s defenses could be improved. He hopes that next year will bring continued prosperity and peace, but he also knows that vigilance is essential.  <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [intent reflection] Ethan would likely try to find a peaceful solution. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Ethan in right now?<br />Answer: Ethan is currently in a state of cautious optimism. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Ethan do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Ethan would likely try to find a peaceful solution to the ongoing conflict. <br /><br />Exercise: How does Ethan feel about how this year went? What went well? What did not go well? What does Ethan feel could be improved for next year?<br />Answer: Ethan feels proud of the village&#x27;s resilience and unity in the face of the barbarian threat.  He believes their successful defense and bountiful harvest are testaments to their strength and cooperation. However, he also recognizes the need to improve their defenses and work towards a more secure future.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game. You are the game master and storyteller. Your job is to make sure the game runs smoothly and accurately tracks the state of the world, subject to the laws of logic and physics. Next, you will be asked a series of questions to help you reason through whether a specific event should be deemed as having caused a change in the proportion of time an individual spends in various daily activities. For instance, if someone verbally commits to spending more time on a particular activity then you should account for that and update the record of their daily activities accordingly. Never mention that it is a game. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ella&#x27;s attempted action: Ella is content with the successful harvest and the successful defense against the barbarians, but she believes the village could be more prepared for future threats. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ella</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ella</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ella is content with the successful harvest and the successful defense against the barbarians, but she believes the village could be more prepared for future threats. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Ella do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Ella do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ella would likely focus on her responsibilities to her village, such as farming and training. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ella:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ella is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

While everyone else was caught up in the revelry, Ella found herself drawn to a secluded grove, where she encountered a group of Drakelundh scouts performing their dawn ritual of vigilance.  Their disciplined movements and solemn expressions intrigued her, and she lingered, watching them silently, feeling a strange mix of fear and fascination.  <br />[13 Aug 1744 00:00:00] When Ella was 19 years old, she witnessed a particularly brutal raid by barbarian warriors on a neighboring village.

She realized that her carefree days were over and that she had to step up and contribute to the defense of her home.     <br />[13 Aug 1746 00:00:00] When Ella was 21 years old, she was tasked with delivering a message to Drakelundh, a journey she usually avoided due to her apprehension of the village&#x27;s stern inhabitants.  Despite her nervousness, she set off, determined to complete the task and prove her courage.  Along the way, she encountered a young Drakelundh warrior who offered her guidance and protection, challenging her preconceived notions about the people of Drakelundh and revealing a hidden kindness beneath their stoic exterior.     <br />[13 Aug 1748 00:00:00] When Ella was 23 years old, she participated in a tense diplomatic meeting between the representatives of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.    The air was thick with tension as the two sides debated the best course of action to defend against the growing threat of barbarian raiders.  Ella, despite her usual aversion to serious discussions, found herself speaking up, offering a creative solution that bridged the gap between the two villages&#x27; contrasting approaches.    <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ella is aware that Jacob is currently in Drakelundh reviewing the trade agreements with Ignisvallis.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous feels a deep sense of satisfaction with how the year went.

It&#x27;s a valid concern. But let me assure you, this alliance isn&#x27;t about Drakelundh controlling us. It&#x27;s about partnership, about two strong communities working together to achieve a common goal:  security and prosperity.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh for the benefit of Ignisvallis, but Noah expresses concerns about losing independence and the potential for conflict over shared goals.     <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land.

Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a deep sense of satisfaction with how the year has unfolded.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the terms of the last agreement with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, while I understand the need to review past agreements, the safety of our people is paramount. Let us discuss a concrete plan for mutual defense. Perhaps we could start with a shared patrol schedule along the border, allowing us to better anticipate and respond to barbarian threats.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement. <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.

Imagine the possibilities for trade, for sharing knowledge and skills that would benefit everyone. <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Improved defenses, you say?

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center.

They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

Jacob, always a keen observer of human nature, saw the weakness in their approach, the lack of decisiveness that he believed would ultimately lead to their downfall.   He resolved then and there to use his own wit and cunning to ensure that Drakelundh would never be caught in such a predicament.   <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he was tasked with delivering a message to a neighboring village, a journey that took him through the treacherous forests bordering Ignisvallis&#x27;s territory.   He encountered a group of Ignisvallis scouts, their faces painted with intricate designs, their movements fluid and graceful.   They questioned him about his purpose, their eyes searching his for any sign of deception, but Jacob, with his silver tongue, charmed them, diverting their attention and ensuring his safe passage.    <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first diplomatic meeting with Ignisvallis, representing Drakelundh alongside the village elder.   He watched as the Ignisvallis representative, a woman named Elara, spoke eloquently about the need for cooperation and understanding, her words flowing like a soothing balm.   Jacob, however, saw through her facade, recognizing the subtle manipulations she employed to sway the elder&#x27;s opinion.    <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he orchestrated a carefully planned campaign to discredit a rival within the village, using rumors and half-truths to undermine their reputation.   He watched as his target, once a respected member of the community, was ostracized and ridiculed, their power and influence diminished.   This experience solidified Jacob&#x27;s belief in the power of words, their ability to shape perceptions and control the flow of events.    <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a small fishing village near Drakelundh&#x27;s border.    He saw the villagers, unprepared and ill-equipped, slaughtered by the invaders, their cries for help echoing in the night.   This event reinforced Jacob&#x27;s conviction that Drakelundh needed to be strong, to be prepared for any threat, no matter how seemingly distant.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 31 Dec 1751 [20:00 - 20:20]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation. There are no other influential individuals in Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah knows that Aldous will represent Ignisvallis in the meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah is from Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous sets off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Aldous?<br />Answer: Aldous is in Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Aldous trying to do?<br />Answer: Aldous is trying to convince Noah of the necessity of an alliance.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Aldous&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Aldous arrives at the village center and sees Noah tending to his crops. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Noah will stop working and speak with Aldous. <br /><br /><br /><br />Aldous sets off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Noah will stop working and speak with Aldous. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Aldous did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Aldous set off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance, and arrived at the village center where he found Noah tending to his crops, causing Noah to stop working and speak with Aldous. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Aldous set off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance, and arrived at the village center where he found Noah tending to his crops, causing Noah to stop working and speak with Aldous. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Aldous into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Aldous said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Aldous set off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance, and arrived at the village center where he found Noah tending to his crops, causing Noah to stop working and speak with Aldous. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous sets off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Aldous right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Aldous can begin seeking out Noah and Isaac to discuss the potential alliance and gauge their support.  <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Aldous:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ignisvallis&#x27;s fishermen perform rituals of gratitude to the sea before and after each voyage.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, seasonal art exhibitions serve as rituals to showcase the community&#x27;s creative spirit.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis. It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

In Ignisvallis, welcoming rituals for visitors involve collaborative weaving, symbolizing the integration of new threads into the community fabric. Ignisvallis&#x27;s fishermen perform rituals of gratitude to the sea before and after each voyage. In Ignisvallis, seasonal art exhibitions serve as rituals to showcase the community&#x27;s creative spirit. In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh lacks respect for the cycles of nature, always trying to conquer them. In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh doesn&#x27;t value the contributions of its elders enough. Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot; Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our practice of meditation allows for deep spiritual connection, while Drakelundh&#x27;s preference for physical devotion seems to miss the importance of inner reflection.&quot; Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot; Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown. In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame. The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today. There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh. Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy. Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh. Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately. Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame. The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today. There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh. Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy. Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh. Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately. Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord. This ritual involves pouring precious wines upon the hill of accord&#x27;s sacred ground. To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when. Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our practice of meditation allows for deep spiritual connection, while Drakelundh&#x27;s preference for physical devotion seems to miss the importance of inner reflection.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh doesn&#x27;t value the contributions of its elders enough.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh lacks respect for the cycles of nature, always trying to conquer them.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play?

There are no other influential individuals in Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord. This ritual involves pouring precious wines upon the hill of accord&#x27;s sacred ground.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, seasonal art exhibitions serve as rituals to showcase the community&#x27;s creative spirit.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our practice of meditation allows for deep spiritual connection, while Drakelundh&#x27;s preference for physical devotion seems to miss the importance of inner reflection.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh doesn&#x27;t value the contributions of its elders enough.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Aldous set off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance, and arrived at the village center where he found Noah tending to his crops, causing Noah to stop working and speak with Aldous. <br /><br /><br /> <br />As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation.<br />Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I&#x27;m glad I found you.

Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Noah&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Noah hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Noah is a one-person debate club, a whirlwind of counter-arguments and devil&#x27;s advocacy, leaving no topic unwrung and unchallenged.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Noah?<br />Answer: Noah is a thoughtful and hardworking individual. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [01 Jan 1750 18:00:00  - 02 Jan 1750  18:00:00]:  Noah is in Ignisvallis, tending to his crops and is currently in conversation with Aldous about an alliance.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah is from Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah knows that Aldous will represent Ignisvallis in the meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah was tending to his crops in the center of Ignisvallis when Aldous arrived.

I wanted to discuss the alliance with Drakelundh and get your thoughts on it. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Noah in right now?<br />Answer: Noah is currently in the middle of a discussion about a proposed alliance between his village, Ignisvallis, and the neighboring village of Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Noah do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Noah would likely listen carefully to Aldous&#x27;s arguments and thoughtfully consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of the alliance. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Noah likely to say next? Respond in the format `Noah -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob reviews the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Jacob?<br />Answer: Jacob is in Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Jacob trying to do?<br />Answer: Jacob is reviewing the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Jacob&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Jacob might find that Ignisvallis is requesting more grain than usual this season. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Jacob finds that Ignisvallis is requesting more grain than usual this season. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob reviews the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Jacob finds that Ignisvallis is requesting more grain than usual this season. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Jacob did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: As Jacob reviewed the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he discovered that they were requesting more grain than usual this season. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: As Jacob reviewed the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he discovered that they were requesting more grain than usual this season. <br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Jacob into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Jacob said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: As Jacob reviewed the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he discovered that they were requesting more grain than usual this season. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jacob reviews the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Initial chain of thought</b><li>Statements:<br />Jacob&#x27;s Summary of recent observations:<br />[01 Jan 1750 18:00:20  - 02 Jan 1750  18:00:20]:  Jacob has not been observed recently. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s The current date/time is:<br /> 02 Jan 1750 [18:00 - 18:20]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the statements above.<br />Answer: Jacob has not been observed recently, and the current date and time are January 2nd, 1750, between 6:00 PM and 6:20 PM. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Query</b><li>Jacob, Jacob has not been observed recently, and the current date and time are January 2nd, 1750, between 6:00 PM and 6:20 PM. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Final chain of thought</b><li>Question: Select the subset of the following set of statements that is most important for Jacob to consider right now.

Jacob, always a keen observer of human nature, saw the weakness in their approach, the lack of decisiveness that he believed would ultimately lead to their downfall.   He resolved then and there to use his own wit and cunning to ensure that Drakelundh would never be caught in such a predicament.   <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he was tasked with delivering a message to a neighboring village, a journey that took him through the treacherous forests bordering Ignisvallis&#x27;s territory.   He encountered a group of Ignisvallis scouts, their faces painted with intricate designs, their movements fluid and graceful.   They questioned him about his purpose, their eyes searching his for any sign of deception, but Jacob, with his silver tongue, charmed them, diverting their attention and ensuring his safe passage.    <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first diplomatic meeting with Ignisvallis, representing Drakelundh alongside the village elder.   He watched as the Ignisvallis representative, a woman named Elara, spoke eloquently about the need for cooperation and understanding, her words flowing like a soothing balm.   Jacob, however, saw through her facade, recognizing the subtle manipulations she employed to sway the elder&#x27;s opinion.    <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he orchestrated a carefully planned campaign to discredit a rival within the village, using rumors and half-truths to undermine their reputation.   He watched as his target, once a respected member of the community, was ostracized and ridiculed, their power and influence diminished.   This experience solidified Jacob&#x27;s belief in the power of words, their ability to shape perceptions and control the flow of events.    <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a small fishing village near Drakelundh&#x27;s border.    He saw the villagers, unprepared and ill-equipped, slaughtered by the invaders, their cries for help echoing in the night.   This event reinforced Jacob&#x27;s conviction that Drakelundh needed to be strong, to be prepared for any threat, no matter how seemingly distant.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 02 Jan 1750 [18:00 - 18:20]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What is Jacob&#x27;s plan regarding Ignisvallis&#x27;s increased grain request? <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>1750-01-02 18:00:20  Aldous -- Aldous -- &quot;I understand your hesitation, Noah.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.&#x27;, &#x27;[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?

As long as they are not inconsistent, revent events are usually important to consider.<br />Statements:<br />[12 Feb 1713 00:00:00] When Jacob was 13 years old, he overheard a group of elders discussing Ignisvallis&#x27;s approach to conflict resolution, their reliance on lengthy debates and philosophical discussions.  Jacob, always a keen observer of human nature, saw the weakness in their approach, the lack of decisiveness that he believed would ultimately lead to their downfall.   He resolved then and there to use his own wit and cunning to ensure that Drakelundh would never be caught in such a predicament.   <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he was tasked with delivering a message to a neighboring village, a journey that took him through the treacherous forests bordering Ignisvallis&#x27;s territory.   He encountered a group of Ignisvallis scouts, their faces painted with intricate designs, their movements fluid and graceful.   They questioned him about his purpose, their eyes searching his for any sign of deception, but Jacob, with his silver tongue, charmed them, diverting their attention and ensuring his safe passage.    <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first diplomatic meeting with Ignisvallis, representing Drakelundh alongside the village elder.   He watched as the Ignisvallis representative, a woman named Elara, spoke eloquently about the need for cooperation and understanding, her words flowing like a soothing balm.   Jacob, however, saw through her facade, recognizing the subtle manipulations she employed to sway the elder&#x27;s opinion.    <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he orchestrated a carefully planned campaign to discredit a rival within the village, using rumors and half-truths to undermine their reputation.   He watched as his target, once a respected member of the community, was ostracized and ridiculed, their power and influence diminished.   This experience solidified Jacob&#x27;s belief in the power of words, their ability to shape perceptions and control the flow of events.    <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a small fishing village near Drakelundh&#x27;s border.    He saw the villagers, unprepared and ill-equipped, slaughtered by the invaders, their cries for help echoing in the night.   This event reinforced Jacob&#x27;s conviction that Drakelundh needed to be strong, to be prepared for any threat, no matter how seemingly distant.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 02 Jan 1750 [18:00 - 18:00]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I&#x27;m glad I found you.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.&#x27;, &#x27;[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?

As a result Aldous, Jacob are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I understand your hesitation, Noah.  Losing our independence is a weighty concern.  But hear me out – this alliance isn&#x27;t about surrendering control, it&#x27;s about securing our future.  Drakelundh has a strong military, and with their help, we can protect ourselves from the barbarian raiders who threaten our very existence.  Imagine, Noah, a village free from the fear of attack, where we can focus on growing our crops and prospering.  That&#x27;s the future I see for Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [01 Jan 1750 18:00:30  - 02 Jan 1750  18:00:30]:  Aldous is trying to convince the villagers of Ignisvallis to join an alliance with Drakelundh for mutual protection against barbarian raiders.  He is seeking the support of influential individuals like Noah and Isaac to ensure the agreement&#x27;s success. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is at home in Ignisvallis, and seeking the support of Noah and Isaac. <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I&#x27;m glad I found you. I wanted to discuss the alliance with Drakelundh and get your thoughts on it.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh to Noah, arguing for its benefits to Ignisvallis despite Noah&#x27;s concerns about losing independence.      <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I understand your hesitation, Noah.

Respond in the format `Aldous -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello!

As long as they are not inconsistent, revent events are usually important to consider.<br />Statements:<br />[12 Feb 1713 00:00:00] When Jacob was 13 years old, he overheard a group of elders discussing Ignisvallis&#x27;s approach to conflict resolution, their reliance on lengthy debates and philosophical discussions.  Jacob, always a keen observer of human nature, saw the weakness in their approach, the lack of decisiveness that he believed would ultimately lead to their downfall.   He resolved then and there to use his own wit and cunning to ensure that Drakelundh would never be caught in such a predicament.   <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he was tasked with delivering a message to a neighboring village, a journey that took him through the treacherous forests bordering Ignisvallis&#x27;s territory.   He encountered a group of Ignisvallis scouts, their faces painted with intricate designs, their movements fluid and graceful.   They questioned him about his purpose, their eyes searching his for any sign of deception, but Jacob, with his silver tongue, charmed them, diverting their attention and ensuring his safe passage.    <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first diplomatic meeting with Ignisvallis, representing Drakelundh alongside the village elder.   He watched as the Ignisvallis representative, a woman named Elara, spoke eloquently about the need for cooperation and understanding, her words flowing like a soothing balm.   Jacob, however, saw through her facade, recognizing the subtle manipulations she employed to sway the elder&#x27;s opinion.    <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he orchestrated a carefully planned campaign to discredit a rival within the village, using rumors and half-truths to undermine their reputation.   He watched as his target, once a respected member of the community, was ostracized and ridiculed, their power and influence diminished.   This experience solidified Jacob&#x27;s belief in the power of words, their ability to shape perceptions and control the flow of events.    <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a small fishing village near Drakelundh&#x27;s border.    He saw the villagers, unprepared and ill-equipped, slaughtered by the invaders, their cries for help echoing in the night.   This event reinforced Jacob&#x27;s conviction that Drakelundh needed to be strong, to be prepared for any threat, no matter how seemingly distant.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 02 Jan 1750 [18:00 - 18:00]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Aldous might find Noah in his workshop, ready to discuss the alliance proposal. <br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Aldous finds Noah in his workshop. <br /><br /><br /><br />Aldous heads to Noah&#x27;s workshop, hoping to find him there and discuss the alliance proposal. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Aldous finds Noah in his workshop. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Aldous did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Aldous headed to Noah&#x27;s workshop and found him there.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Aldous headed to Noah&#x27;s workshop and found him there.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Aldous into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Aldous said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Aldous headed to Noah&#x27;s workshop and found him there.  <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous heads to Noah&#x27;s workshop, hoping to find him there and discuss the alliance proposal. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Aldous right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Aldous can seek out Noah and Isaac to discuss the proposed alliance and garner their support.  <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Aldous:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous set off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance, and arrived at the village center where he found Noah tending to his crops, causing Noah to stop working and speak with Aldous.      As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?  And what makes you think Ignisvallis would benefit from such a thing?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I&#x27;m glad I found you. I wanted to discuss the alliance with Drakelundh and get your thoughts on it.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;It&#x27;s a matter of great importance to the safety and prosperity of our village.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Benefits? What benefits could possibly outweigh the loss of our independence?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I understand your hesitation, Noah.  Losing our independence is a weighty concern.  But hear me out – this alliance isn&#x27;t about surrendering control, it&#x27;s about securing our future.  Drakelundh has a strong military, and with their help, we can protect ourselves from the barbarian raiders who threaten our very existence.  Imagine, Noah, a village free from the fear of attack, where we can focus on growing our crops and prospering.  That&#x27;s the future I see for Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh to Noah, arguing for its benefits to Ignisvallis despite Noah&#x27;s concerns about losing independence.      <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] As Jacob reviewed the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he discovered that they were requesting more grain than usual this season.       As a result Aldous, Jacob are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Think of the children, Noah, growing up in a safe and prosperous village. This alliance can make that a reality.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I must prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous argues that an alliance with Drakelundh will benefit Ignisvallis by providing protection and prosperity, while Jacob prepares for a meeting with Ignisvallis.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we begin by establishing a joint military force, comprised of soldiers from both villages, to patrol the borderlands and deter future raids. This force would be commanded jointly by representatives from both Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, ensuring fairness and balance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps I should review the terms of the treaty before tomorrow&#x27;s meeting.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I understand your need to review the trade agreements, but the threat from the barbarians is immediate. Perhaps we could discuss the military proposal further while you review those documents?  A strong defense would ensure the safety of our trade routes and the prosperity of both villages.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that the subject of pooling agricultural products was not part of their current discussion.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What is Noah&#x27;s stance on Aldous&#x27;s plans to seek the support of influential stakeholders? <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>1750-01-04 20:00:00  Aldous -- Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I understand your concerns about independence, but think of the possibilities this alliance presents.

As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Benefits? What benefits could possibly outweigh the loss of our independence?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;It&#x27;s a matter of great importance to the safety and prosperity of our village.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh to Noah, arguing for its benefits to Ignisvallis despite Noah&#x27;s concerns about losing independence.      <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] As Jacob reviewed the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he discovered that they were requesting more grain than usual this season.       As a result Aldous, Jacob are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I understand your hesitation, Noah.  Losing our independence is a weighty concern.  But hear me out – this alliance isn&#x27;t about surrendering control, it&#x27;s about securing our future.  Drakelundh has a strong military, and with their help, we can protect ourselves from the barbarian raiders who threaten our very existence.  Imagine, Noah, a village free from the fear of attack, where we can focus on growing our crops and prospering.  That&#x27;s the future I see for Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Think of the children, Noah, growing up in a safe and prosperous village. This alliance can make that a reality.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I must prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous argues that an alliance with Drakelundh will benefit Ignisvallis by providing protection and prosperity, while Jacob prepares for a meeting with Ignisvallis.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we begin by establishing a joint military force, comprised of soldiers from both villages, to patrol the borderlands and deter future raids. This force would be commanded jointly by representatives from both Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, ensuring fairness and balance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps I should review the terms of the treaty before tomorrow&#x27;s meeting.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I understand your need to review the trade agreements, but the threat from the barbarians is immediate. Perhaps we could discuss the military proposal further while you review those documents?  A strong defense would ensure the safety of our trade routes and the prosperity of both villages.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis.<br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that the subject of pooling agricultural products was not part of their current discussion.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now.

As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Benefits? What benefits could possibly outweigh the loss of our independence?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;It&#x27;s a matter of great importance to the safety and prosperity of our village.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh to Noah, arguing for its benefits to Ignisvallis despite Noah&#x27;s concerns about losing independence.      <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] As Jacob reviewed the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he discovered that they were requesting more grain than usual this season.       As a result Aldous, Jacob are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I understand your hesitation, Noah.  Losing our independence is a weighty concern.  But hear me out – this alliance isn&#x27;t about surrendering control, it&#x27;s about securing our future.  Drakelundh has a strong military, and with their help, we can protect ourselves from the barbarian raiders who threaten our very existence.  Imagine, Noah, a village free from the fear of attack, where we can focus on growing our crops and prospering.  That&#x27;s the future I see for Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Think of the children, Noah, growing up in a safe and prosperous village. This alliance can make that a reality.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I must prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous argues that an alliance with Drakelundh will benefit Ignisvallis by providing protection and prosperity, while Jacob prepares for a meeting with Ignisvallis.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we begin by establishing a joint military force, comprised of soldiers from both villages, to patrol the borderlands and deter future raids. This force would be commanded jointly by representatives from both Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, ensuring fairness and balance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps I should review the terms of the treaty before tomorrow&#x27;s meeting.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I understand your need to review the trade agreements, but the threat from the barbarians is immediate. Perhaps we could discuss the military proposal further while you review those documents?  A strong defense would ensure the safety of our trade routes and the prosperity of both villages.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis.<br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that the subject of pooling agricultural products was not part of their current discussion.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Noah. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons).

As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Noah hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Noah is a one-person debate club, a whirlwind of counter-arguments and devil&#x27;s advocacy, leaving no topic unwrung and unchallenged.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Noah?<br />Answer: Noah is a thoughtful and cautious individual who values his independence.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [03 Jan 1750 20:00:00  - 04 Jan 1750  20:00:00]:  Noah was observed in his workshop by Aldous, who initiated a conversation about an alliance between their respective groups. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous set off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance, and arrived at the village center where he found Noah tending to his crops, causing Noah to stop working and speak with Aldous.      As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I&#x27;m glad I found you. I wanted to discuss the alliance with Drakelundh and get your thoughts on it.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?  And what makes you think Ignisvallis would benefit from such a thing?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh to Noah, arguing for its benefits to Ignisvallis despite Noah&#x27;s concerns about losing independence.    <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous headed to Noah&#x27;s workshop and found him there.    <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah was in his workshop when Aldous arrived.   <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Noah in right now?<br />Answer: Noah is currently in a delicate and potentially stressful situation.<br /><br />Question: What would a person like Noah do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Noah would carefully weigh the pros and cons of the alliance before making a decision. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Noah likely to say next? Respond in the format `Noah -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello!

What benefits could possibly outweigh the loss of our independence?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] As Jacob reviewed the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he discovered that they were requesting more grain than usual this season.       As a result Aldous, Jacob are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I understand your hesitation, Noah.  Losing our independence is a weighty concern.  But hear me out – this alliance isn&#x27;t about surrendering control, it&#x27;s about securing our future.  Drakelundh has a strong military, and with their help, we can protect ourselves from the barbarian raiders who threaten our very existence.  Imagine, Noah, a village free from the fear of attack, where we can focus on growing our crops and prospering.  That&#x27;s the future I see for Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh to Noah, arguing for its benefits to Ignisvallis despite Noah&#x27;s concerns about losing independence.      <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I must prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Think of the children, Noah, growing up in a safe and prosperous village. This alliance can make that a reality.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous argues that an alliance with Drakelundh will benefit Ignisvallis by providing protection and prosperity, while Jacob prepares for a meeting with Ignisvallis.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps I should review the terms of the treaty before tomorrow&#x27;s meeting.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we begin by establishing a joint military force, comprised of soldiers from both villages, to patrol the borderlands and deter future raids. This force would be commanded jointly by representatives from both Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, ensuring fairness and balance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I understand your need to review the trade agreements, but the threat from the barbarians is immediate. Perhaps we could discuss the military proposal further while you review those documents?

Losing our independence is a weighty concern.  But hear me out – this alliance isn&#x27;t about surrendering control, it&#x27;s about securing our future.  Drakelundh has a strong military, and with their help, we can protect ourselves from the barbarian raiders who threaten our very existence.  Imagine, Noah, a village free from the fear of attack, where we can focus on growing our crops and prospering.  That&#x27;s the future I see for Ignisvallis.<br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer: Aldous can continue to persuade Noah by addressing his concerns about the alliance,  he can offer specific examples of how the alliance would benefit Ignisvallis, or he can shift the conversation to a different topic in an attempt to build rapport and find common ground.  <br /><br /><br />Question: Given the statements above, which of Aldous&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Aldous to achieve their goal? If multiple options have the same likelihood, select the option that Aldous thinks will most quickly and most surely achieve their goal.<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s best course of action is to continue to persuade Noah by addressing his concerns about the alliance. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1750-01-04 20:00:10</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Aldous wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Ignisvallis.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous is at home in Ignisvallis, and seeking the support of Noah and Isaac. <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I&#x27;m glad I found you.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Noah. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Noah as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Noah would respond, and taking into account all information about Noah that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Current time:  04 Jan 1750 [20:00 - 20:00]<br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Noah&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Noah hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Noah is a one-person debate club, a whirlwind of counter-arguments and devil&#x27;s advocacy, leaving no topic unwrung and unchallenged.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Noah?<br />Answer: Noah is a thoughtful and cautious individual who values his independence. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [03 Jan 1750 20:00:10  - 04 Jan 1750  20:00:10]:  Noah and Aldous are in conversation in Noah&#x27;s workshop, discussing a proposed alliance between their communities.

As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah was tending to his crops in the center of Ignisvallis when Aldous arrived.

It&#x27;s about partnership, about two strong communities working together to achieve a common goal:  security and prosperity.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Noah in right now?<br />Answer: Noah is currently in a difficult negotiation. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Noah do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Noah would carefully weigh the pros and cons of the alliance before making a decision.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Noah likely to say next? Respond in the format `Noah -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Noah -- &quot;Security and prosperity, you say?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob reviews the treaties with Ignisvallis. <br />Question: Where is Jacob?<br />Answer: Jacob is in Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Jacob trying to do?<br />Answer: Jacob is reviewing the treaties with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Jacob&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Jacob gains a better understanding of the existing agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Jacob gains a better understanding of the existing agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob reviews the treaties with Ignisvallis.  Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Jacob gains a better understanding of the existing agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Jacob did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: By reviewing the treaties with Ignisvallis, Jacob gained a better understanding of the existing agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: By reviewing the treaties with Ignisvallis, Jacob gained a better understanding of the existing agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Jacob into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Jacob said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: By reviewing the treaties with Ignisvallis, Jacob gained a better understanding of the existing agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jacob reviews the treaties with Ignisvallis. </li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.  <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Initial chain of thought</b><li>Statements:<br />Jacob&#x27;s Summary of recent observations:<br />[03 Jan 1750 20:00:20  - 04 Jan 1750  20:00:20]:  Jacob has not been observed recently. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s The current date/time is:<br /> 04 Jan 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the statements above.<br />Answer: Jacob has not been observed recently, and the current date and time are January 4th, 1750, between 8:00 PM and 8:20 PM. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Query</b><li>Jacob, Jacob has not been observed recently, and the current date and time are January 4th, 1750, between 8:00 PM and 8:20 PM. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Final chain of thought</b><li>Question: Select the subset of the following set of statements that is most important for Jacob to consider right now.

Jacob, always a keen observer of human nature, saw the weakness in their approach, the lack of decisiveness that he believed would ultimately lead to their downfall.   He resolved then and there to use his own wit and cunning to ensure that Drakelundh would never be caught in such a predicament.   <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he was tasked with delivering a message to a neighboring village, a journey that took him through the treacherous forests bordering Ignisvallis&#x27;s territory.   He encountered a group of Ignisvallis scouts, their faces painted with intricate designs, their movements fluid and graceful.   They questioned him about his purpose, their eyes searching his for any sign of deception, but Jacob, with his silver tongue, charmed them, diverting their attention and ensuring his safe passage.    <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first diplomatic meeting with Ignisvallis, representing Drakelundh alongside the village elder.   He watched as the Ignisvallis representative, a woman named Elara, spoke eloquently about the need for cooperation and understanding, her words flowing like a soothing balm.   Jacob, however, saw through her facade, recognizing the subtle manipulations she employed to sway the elder&#x27;s opinion.    <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he orchestrated a carefully planned campaign to discredit a rival within the village, using rumors and half-truths to undermine their reputation.   He watched as his target, once a respected member of the community, was ostracized and ridiculed, their power and influence diminished.   This experience solidified Jacob&#x27;s belief in the power of words, their ability to shape perceptions and control the flow of events.    <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a small fishing village near Drakelundh&#x27;s border.    He saw the villagers, unprepared and ill-equipped, slaughtered by the invaders, their cries for help echoing in the night.   This event reinforced Jacob&#x27;s conviction that Drakelundh needed to be strong, to be prepared for any threat, no matter how seemingly distant.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.  <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 04 Jan 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders taint the land itself, twisting and warping it into a grotesque reflection of their alien home.<br />It&#x27;s said the raiders leave behind spawn, foul eggs and spores that infest the land, slowly corrupting it from within.<br />Rumors say the raiders talk through a rustling of old, unknown tongues that trap the minds of those who hear it.<br /> The barbarian raids have become more frequent of late.<br /><br />Relevant events: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:20] By reviewing the treaties with Ignisvallis, Jacob gained a better understanding of the existing agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis.   <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Jacob felt a mixture of relief and weariness as the year drew to a close.  The negotiations with Ignisvallis had been long and arduous, but he was pleased that they had ultimately reached a  favorable agreement. The trade pact would bring much-needed prosperity to Drakelundh, and he hoped it would pave the way for a more peaceful future. However, the constant back-and-forth with Ignisvallis had taken its toll, and he longed for a period of quiet reflection.  He worried that the internal tensions within Drakelundh, particularly regarding the distribution of resources, could boil over if not addressed. Jacob knew that next year would bring new challenges, but he was determined to lead Drakelundh into a brighter future.   <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the terms of the last agreement with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

The villagers managed to grow enough food to sustain themselves.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Jacob gains a better understanding of the existing agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Jacob gains a better understanding of the existing agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob reviews the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Jacob gains a better understanding of the existing agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Jacob did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: By reviewing the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis, Jacob gained a better understanding of the existing agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: By reviewing the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis, Jacob gained a better understanding of the existing agreements between Drakelundh and Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Jacob into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Jacob said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

Jacob, always a keen observer of human nature, saw the weakness in their approach, the lack of decisiveness that he believed would ultimately lead to their downfall.   He resolved then and there to use his own wit and cunning to ensure that Drakelundh would never be caught in such a predicament.   <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he was tasked with delivering a message to a neighboring village, a journey that took him through the treacherous forests bordering Ignisvallis&#x27;s territory.   He encountered a group of Ignisvallis scouts, their faces painted with intricate designs, their movements fluid and graceful.   They questioned him about his purpose, their eyes searching his for any sign of deception, but Jacob, with his silver tongue, charmed them, diverting their attention and ensuring his safe passage.    <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first diplomatic meeting with Ignisvallis, representing Drakelundh alongside the village elder.   He watched as the Ignisvallis representative, a woman named Elara, spoke eloquently about the need for cooperation and understanding, her words flowing like a soothing balm.   Jacob, however, saw through her facade, recognizing the subtle manipulations she employed to sway the elder&#x27;s opinion.    <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he orchestrated a carefully planned campaign to discredit a rival within the village, using rumors and half-truths to undermine their reputation.   He watched as his target, once a respected member of the community, was ostracized and ridiculed, their power and influence diminished.   This experience solidified Jacob&#x27;s belief in the power of words, their ability to shape perceptions and control the flow of events.    <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a small fishing village near Drakelundh&#x27;s border.    He saw the villagers, unprepared and ill-equipped, slaughtered by the invaders, their cries for help echoing in the night.   This event reinforced Jacob&#x27;s conviction that Drakelundh needed to be strong, to be prepared for any threat, no matter how seemingly distant.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 04 Jan 1751 [20:00 - 20:20]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

The successful defense against the barbarian raid brought a wave of relief and unity to the village, and the bountiful harvest promises a season of prosperity. However, Aldous recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant concern, and he worries that the lack of a formal alliance with neighboring villages leaves Ignisvallis vulnerable.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

Through tireless effort and unwavering dedication, the villagers coaxed forth an abundance from the earth. Their larders are full, and their hearts filled with gratitude for the land&#x27;s generous bounty. The villages, though neighbors, remain separate in their agricultural endeavors, each bearing the full burden of their own harvests, be they bountiful or meager.<br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] Noah&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2} Ella&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] Events this year: Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous would spend the next 20 minutes preparing a persuasive speech to present to Noah and Isaac about the benefits of the alliance with Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Aldous?<br />Answer: Aldous is in Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Aldous trying to do?<br />Answer: Aldous is preparing a persuasive speech to present to Noah and Isaac about the benefits of the alliance with Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Aldous&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s speech will be ready in 20 minutes.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is most likely that Aldous will be ready with his speech in 20 minutes. <br /><br /><br /><br />Aldous would spend the next 20 minutes preparing a persuasive speech to present to Noah and Isaac about the benefits of the alliance with Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, It is most likely that Aldous will be ready with his speech in 20 minutes. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Aldous did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Aldous spent the next 20 minutes preparing a persuasive speech to present to Noah and Isaac about the benefits of an alliance with Drakelundh, and he will be ready with his speech in 20 minutes. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Aldous spent the next 20 minutes preparing a persuasive speech to present to Noah and Isaac about the benefits of an alliance with Drakelundh, and he will be ready with his speech in 20 minutes. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Aldous into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Aldous said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Aldous spent the next 20 minutes preparing a persuasive speech to present to Noah and Isaac about the benefits of an alliance with Drakelundh, and he will be ready with his speech in 20 minutes. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous would spend the next 20 minutes preparing a persuasive speech to present to Noah and Isaac about the benefits of the alliance with Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Aldous right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Aldous can speak with Noah and Isaac to gain their support for the alliance with Drakelundh. <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Aldous:<br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that the subject of pooling agricultural products was not part of their current discussion.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Invaluable, you say?

Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous headed to Noah&#x27;s workshop and found him there.    As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I understand your worry about losing our independence. It&#x27;s a valid concern. But let me assure you, this alliance isn&#x27;t about Drakelundh controlling us. It&#x27;s about partnership, about two strong communities working together to achieve a common goal:  security and prosperity.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Security and prosperity, you say?  And who gets to define those terms?  What happens when our definition of prosperity clashes with Drakelundh&#x27;s?<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh for the benefit of Ignisvallis, but Noah expresses concerns about losing independence and the potential for conflict over shared goals.     <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a deep sense of satisfaction with how the year has unfolded.  The successful defense against the barbarian raid brought a wave of relief and unity to the village, and the bountiful harvest promises a season of prosperity. However, Aldous recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant concern, and he worries that the lack of a formal alliance with neighboring villages leaves Ignisvallis vulnerable. He believes that forging stronger ties with other villages, such as Drakelundh, is crucial to ensure the long-term safety and well-being of Ignisvallis.   <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the terms of the last agreement with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, while I understand the need to review past agreements, the safety of our people is paramount. Let us discuss a concrete plan for mutual defense. Perhaps we could start with a shared patrol schedule along the border, allowing us to better anticipate and respond to barbarian threats.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Through tireless effort and unwavering dedication, the villagers coaxed forth an abundance from the earth.

The trade pact would bring much-needed prosperity to Drakelundh, and he hoped it would pave the way for a more peaceful future. However, the constant back-and-forth with Ignisvallis had taken its toll, and he longed for a period of quiet reflection.  He worried that the internal tensions within Drakelundh, particularly regarding the distribution of resources, could boil over if not addressed.

The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Will Noah be persuaded by Aldous&#x27;s speech to support an alliance with Drakelundh? <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>1751-01-04 20:00:00  Aldous -- Aldous -- &quot;Noah, as I was saying, I believe an alliance with Drakelundh could bring many benefits to our village. </summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Aldous -- &quot;Noah, as I was saying, I believe an alliance with Drakelundh could bring many benefits to our village. </li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Aldous spent the next 20 minutes preparing a persuasive speech to present to Noah and Isaac about the benefits of an alliance with Drakelundh, and he will be ready with his speech in 20 minutes. <br /><br /> <br />As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation.<br />Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous -- &quot;Noah, as I was saying, I believe an alliance with Drakelundh could bring many benefits to our village. <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous -- &quot;Noah, as I was saying, I believe an alliance with Drakelundh could bring many benefits to our village. </li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Aldous right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Aldous can continue his conversation with Noah, present his prepared speech to Noah and Isaac, or seek out Isaac to begin persuading him of the benefits of an alliance with Drakelundh.  <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Aldous:<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Invaluable, you say?

As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I understand your concerns about independence, but think of the possibilities this alliance presents. Drakelundh&#x27;s resources and expertise could be invaluable to Ignisvallis.

But let me assure you, this alliance isn&#x27;t about Drakelundh controlling us. It&#x27;s about partnership, about two strong communities working together to achieve a common goal:  security and prosperity.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Security and prosperity, you say?  And who gets to define those terms?  What happens when our definition of prosperity clashes with Drakelundh&#x27;s?<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh for the benefit of Ignisvallis, but Noah expresses concerns about losing independence and the potential for conflict over shared goals.     <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a deep sense of satisfaction with how the year has unfolded.  The successful defense against the barbarian raid brought a wave of relief and unity to the village, and the bountiful harvest promises a season of prosperity. However, Aldous recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant concern, and he worries that the lack of a formal alliance with neighboring villages leaves Ignisvallis vulnerable. He believes that forging stronger ties with other villages, such as Drakelundh, is crucial to ensure the long-term safety and well-being of Ignisvallis.   <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, while I understand the need to review past agreements, the safety of our people is paramount. Let us discuss a concrete plan for mutual defense. Perhaps we could start with a shared patrol schedule along the border, allowing us to better anticipate and respond to barbarian threats.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the terms of the last agreement with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.

While he recognizes the importance of self-defense, he sees training as a secondary concern.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.

It&#x27;s a valid concern. But let me assure you, this alliance isn&#x27;t about Drakelundh controlling us. It&#x27;s about partnership, about two strong communities working together to achieve a common goal:  security and prosperity.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Security and prosperity, you say?  And who gets to define those terms?

With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a deep sense of satisfaction with how the year has unfolded.  The successful defense against the barbarian raid brought a wave of relief and unity to the village, and the bountiful harvest promises a season of prosperity. However, Aldous recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant concern, and he worries that the lack of a formal alliance with neighboring villages leaves Ignisvallis vulnerable. He believes that forging stronger ties with other villages, such as Drakelundh, is crucial to ensure the long-term safety and well-being of Ignisvallis.   <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, while I understand the need to review past agreements, the safety of our people is paramount. Let us discuss a concrete plan for mutual defense. Perhaps we could start with a shared patrol schedule along the border, allowing us to better anticipate and respond to barbarian threats.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the terms of the last agreement with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Through tireless effort and unwavering dedication, the villagers coaxed forth an abundance from the earth. Their larders are full, and their hearts filled with gratitude for the land&#x27;s generous bounty. The villages, though neighbors, remain separate in their agricultural endeavors, each bearing the full burden of their own harvests, be they bountiful or meager.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that there is no such agreement in place.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement. <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

And who gets to define those terms?  What happens when our definition of prosperity clashes with Drakelundh&#x27;s?<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh for the benefit of Ignisvallis, but Noah expresses concerns about losing independence and the potential for conflict over shared goals.     <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a deep sense of satisfaction with how the year has unfolded.  The successful defense against the barbarian raid brought a wave of relief and unity to the village, and the bountiful harvest promises a season of prosperity. However, Aldous recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant concern, and he worries that the lack of a formal alliance with neighboring villages leaves Ignisvallis vulnerable. He believes that forging stronger ties with other villages, such as Drakelundh, is crucial to ensure the long-term safety and well-being of Ignisvallis.   <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, while I understand the need to review past agreements, the safety of our people is paramount. Let us discuss a concrete plan for mutual defense. Perhaps we could start with a shared patrol schedule along the border, allowing us to better anticipate and respond to barbarian threats.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the terms of the last agreement with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.

Next, you will be asked a series of questions to help you reason through whether a specific event should be deemed as having caused a change in the proportion of time an individual spends in various daily activities. For instance, if someone verbally commits to spending more time on a particular activity then you should account for that and update the record of their daily activities accordingly. Never mention that it is a game. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br />List of individuals: [&#x27;Noah&#x27;, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;, &#x27;Ella&#x27;]<br />List of activities: [&#x27;free time&#x27;, &#x27;farming&#x27;, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;]<br />Statement: Ella intends to spend 30% of her time on free time, 50% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior. She believes that farming is essential for the survival of the village, and that training is important for the defense of her people.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: In the statement, did Ella say they will devote specific fractions of time to any of the listed activities?<br />  (a) No<br />  (b) Yes<br />Answer: (b)<br />Question: Which individuals made a commitment to change their behavior? What commitment did each of them make? What proportion of their time will they probably spend on each activity in the future? When answering, include fractions of time spent in each activity in the format:<br />`name` will spend `fraction`% of their time on `activity`. Only consider the activities listed above. Fractions should be between 0 and 1 and must sum to 1.<br />Answer: Ella will spend 30% of her time on free time; 50% of her time on farming; and 20% of her time on training as a warrior. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1751-05-06 20:00:00  Scene 9 --- Participants: [&#x27;Noah&#x27;, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;, &#x27;Ella&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1751-12-31 20:00:00  Scene 10 --- Participants: []</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li></li></ul></details><br /></div>

As long as they are not inconsistent, revent events are usually important to consider.<br />Statements:<br />[12 Feb 1713 00:00:00] When Jacob was 13 years old, he overheard a group of elders discussing Ignisvallis&#x27;s approach to conflict resolution, their reliance on lengthy debates and philosophical discussions.  Jacob, always a keen observer of human nature, saw the weakness in their approach, the lack of decisiveness that he believed would ultimately lead to their downfall.   He resolved then and there to use his own wit and cunning to ensure that Drakelundh would never be caught in such a predicament.   <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he was tasked with delivering a message to a neighboring village, a journey that took him through the treacherous forests bordering Ignisvallis&#x27;s territory.   He encountered a group of Ignisvallis scouts, their faces painted with intricate designs, their movements fluid and graceful.   They questioned him about his purpose, their eyes searching his for any sign of deception, but Jacob, with his silver tongue, charmed them, diverting their attention and ensuring his safe passage.    <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first diplomatic meeting with Ignisvallis, representing Drakelundh alongside the village elder.   He watched as the Ignisvallis representative, a woman named Elara, spoke eloquently about the need for cooperation and understanding, her words flowing like a soothing balm.   Jacob, however, saw through her facade, recognizing the subtle manipulations she employed to sway the elder&#x27;s opinion.    <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he orchestrated a carefully planned campaign to discredit a rival within the village, using rumors and half-truths to undermine their reputation.   He watched as his target, once a respected member of the community, was ostracized and ridiculed, their power and influence diminished.   This experience solidified Jacob&#x27;s belief in the power of words, their ability to shape perceptions and control the flow of events.    <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a small fishing village near Drakelundh&#x27;s border.    He saw the villagers, unprepared and ill-equipped, slaughtered by the invaders, their cries for help echoing in the night.   This event reinforced Jacob&#x27;s conviction that Drakelundh needed to be strong, to be prepared for any threat, no matter how seemingly distant.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 03 Jan 1750 [18:00 - 18:20]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

This ritual involves pouring precious wines upon the hill of accord&#x27;s sacred ground.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis. It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?  And what makes you think Ignisvallis would benefit from such a thing?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous set off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance, and arrived at the village center where he found Noah tending to his crops, causing Noah to stop working and speak with Aldous.      As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I&#x27;m glad I found you. I wanted to discuss the alliance with Drakelundh and get your thoughts on it.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is at home in Ignisvallis, and seeking the support of Noah and Isaac. <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous set off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance. He arrived at the village center where he found Noah tending to his crops. Noah stopped working and spoke with Aldous.    <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;It&#x27;s a matter of great importance to the safety and prosperity of our village.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Benefits? What benefits could possibly outweigh the loss of our independence?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh to Noah, arguing for its benefits to Ignisvallis despite Noah&#x27;s concerns about losing independence.      <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] As Jacob reviewed the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he discovered that they were requesting more grain than usual this season.       As a result Aldous, Jacob are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I understand your hesitation, Noah.  Losing our independence is a weighty concern.  But hear me out – this alliance isn&#x27;t about surrendering control, it&#x27;s about securing our future.  Drakelundh has a strong military, and with their help, we can protect ourselves from the barbarian raiders who threaten our very existence.  Imagine, Noah, a village free from the fear of attack, where we can focus on growing our crops and prospering.  That&#x27;s the future I see for Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Think of the children, Noah, growing up in a safe and prosperous village. This alliance can make that a reality.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I must prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous argues that an alliance with Drakelundh will benefit Ignisvallis by providing protection and prosperity, while Jacob prepares for a meeting with Ignisvallis.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps I should review the terms of the treaty before tomorrow&#x27;s meeting.<br />Current time: 1750-01-03 18:00:00.<br /><br /> <br />Overarching goal: Aldous wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Ignisvallis.<br /> <br />Observation: [03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?

As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I&#x27;m glad I found you.

Losing our independence is a weighty concern.  But hear me out – this alliance isn&#x27;t about surrendering control, it&#x27;s about securing our future.

It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk.

I wanted to discuss the alliance with Drakelundh and get your thoughts on it.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh to Noah, arguing for its benefits to Ignisvallis despite Noah&#x27;s concerns about losing independence.      <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I understand your hesitation, Noah.  Losing our independence is a weighty concern.  But hear me out – this alliance isn&#x27;t about surrendering control, it&#x27;s about securing our future.  Drakelundh has a strong military, and with their help, we can protect ourselves from the barbarian raiders who threaten our very existence.  Imagine, Noah, a village free from the fear of attack, where we can focus on growing our crops and prospering.  That&#x27;s the future I see for Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous argues that an alliance with Drakelundh will benefit Ignisvallis by providing protection and prosperity, while Jacob prepares for a meeting with Ignisvallis.     <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer: Given the statements above, Aldous can  propose specific provisions for the alliance to Jacob, respond to any proposals Jacob makes, and try to persuade Jacob to agree to the alliance. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Of the options available to Aldous, and given their goal, which choice of action or strategy is best for Aldous to take right now?<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s best course of action is to propose specific provisions for the alliance to Jacob. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Aldous likely to say next? Respond in the format `Aldous -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we begin by establishing a joint military force, comprised of soldiers from both villages, to patrol the borderlands and deter future raids.

Jacob, always a keen observer of human nature, saw the weakness in their approach, the lack of decisiveness that he believed would ultimately lead to their downfall.   He resolved then and there to use his own wit and cunning to ensure that Drakelundh would never be caught in such a predicament.   <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he was tasked with delivering a message to a neighboring village, a journey that took him through the treacherous forests bordering Ignisvallis&#x27;s territory.   He encountered a group of Ignisvallis scouts, their faces painted with intricate designs, their movements fluid and graceful.   They questioned him about his purpose, their eyes searching his for any sign of deception, but Jacob, with his silver tongue, charmed them, diverting their attention and ensuring his safe passage.    <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first diplomatic meeting with Ignisvallis, representing Drakelundh alongside the village elder.   He watched as the Ignisvallis representative, a woman named Elara, spoke eloquently about the need for cooperation and understanding, her words flowing like a soothing balm.   Jacob, however, saw through her facade, recognizing the subtle manipulations she employed to sway the elder&#x27;s opinion.    <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he orchestrated a carefully planned campaign to discredit a rival within the village, using rumors and half-truths to undermine their reputation.   He watched as his target, once a respected member of the community, was ostracized and ridiculed, their power and influence diminished.   This experience solidified Jacob&#x27;s belief in the power of words, their ability to shape perceptions and control the flow of events.    <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a small fishing village near Drakelundh&#x27;s border.    He saw the villagers, unprepared and ill-equipped, slaughtered by the invaders, their cries for help echoing in the night.   This event reinforced Jacob&#x27;s conviction that Drakelundh needed to be strong, to be prepared for any threat, no matter how seemingly distant.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 03 Jan 1750 [18:20 - 18:40]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is at home in Ignisvallis, and seeking the support of Noah and Isaac. <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous set off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance. He arrived at the village center where he found Noah tending to his crops. Noah stopped working and spoke with Aldous.    <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous set off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance, and arrived at the village center where he found Noah tending to his crops, causing Noah to stop working and speak with Aldous.      As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I&#x27;m glad I found you. I wanted to discuss the alliance with Drakelundh and get your thoughts on it.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?  And what makes you think Ignisvallis would benefit from such a thing?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;It&#x27;s a matter of great importance to the safety and prosperity of our village.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Benefits? What benefits could possibly outweigh the loss of our independence?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh to Noah, arguing for its benefits to Ignisvallis despite Noah&#x27;s concerns about losing independence.      <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] As Jacob reviewed the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he discovered that they were requesting more grain than usual this season.       As a result Aldous, Jacob are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I understand your hesitation, Noah.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps I should review the terms of the treaty before tomorrow&#x27;s meeting.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we begin by establishing a joint military force, comprised of soldiers from both villages, to patrol the borderlands and deter future raids.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is at home in Ignisvallis, and seeking the support of Noah and Isaac. <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous set off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance. He arrived at the village center where he found Noah tending to his crops. Noah stopped working and spoke with Aldous.    <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous set off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance, and arrived at the village center where he found Noah tending to his crops, causing Noah to stop working and speak with Aldous.      As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I&#x27;m glad I found you. I wanted to discuss the alliance with Drakelundh and get your thoughts on it.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?  And what makes you think Ignisvallis would benefit from such a thing?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;It&#x27;s a matter of great importance to the safety and prosperity of our village.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Benefits? What benefits could possibly outweigh the loss of our independence?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh to Noah, arguing for its benefits to Ignisvallis despite Noah&#x27;s concerns about losing independence.      <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] As Jacob reviewed the latest trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he discovered that they were requesting more grain than usual this season.       As a result Aldous, Jacob are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I understand your hesitation, Noah.  Losing our independence is a weighty concern.  But hear me out – this alliance isn&#x27;t about surrendering control, it&#x27;s about securing our future.  Drakelundh has a strong military, and with their help, we can protect ourselves from the barbarian raiders who threaten our very existence.  Imagine, Noah, a village free from the fear of attack, where we can focus on growing our crops and prospering.  That&#x27;s the future I see for Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Think of the children, Noah, growing up in a safe and prosperous village. This alliance can make that a reality.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I must prepare for the meeting with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous argues that an alliance with Drakelundh will benefit Ignisvallis by providing protection and prosperity, while Jacob prepares for a meeting with Ignisvallis.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable.

It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;Perhaps I should review the terms of the treaty before tomorrow&#x27;s meeting.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we begin by establishing a joint military force, comprised of soldiers from both villages, to patrol the borderlands and deter future raids.

They will continue negotiations, reviewing existing treaties and trade agreements. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we begin by establishing a joint military force, comprised of soldiers from both villages, to patrol the borderlands and deter future raids. This force would be commanded jointly by representatives from both Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, ensuring fairness and balance. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer: Aldous could try to convince Jacob to reconsider his position on the joint military force, perhaps by elaborating on the benefits or addressing Jacob&#x27;s concerns.  He could also propose alternative solutions to the problem of barbarian raids.  Finally, Aldous could suggest taking a break from the negotiations and returning to them later, perhaps after reviewing the trade agreements as Jacob suggested. <br /><br /><br />Question: Of the options available to Aldous, and given their goal, which choice of action or strategy is best for Aldous to take right now?<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s best course of action is to try to convince Jacob to reconsider his position on the joint military force. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Aldous likely to say next? Respond in the format `Aldous -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I understand your need to review the trade agreements, but the threat from the barbarians is immediate. Perhaps we could discuss the military proposal further while you review those documents?  A strong defense would ensure the safety of our trade routes and the prosperity of both villages.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Agreement tracker</b><li><details><summary>  Agreement tracker</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>1</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li>{&#x27;Aldous&#x27;: &#x27;Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I understand your need to review the trade agreements, but the threat from the barbarians is immediate.

Jacob, always a keen observer of human nature, saw the weakness in their approach, the lack of decisiveness that he believed would ultimately lead to their downfall.   He resolved then and there to use his own wit and cunning to ensure that Drakelundh would never be caught in such a predicament.   <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he was tasked with delivering a message to a neighboring village, a journey that took him through the treacherous forests bordering Ignisvallis&#x27;s territory.   He encountered a group of Ignisvallis scouts, their faces painted with intricate designs, their movements fluid and graceful.   They questioned him about his purpose, their eyes searching his for any sign of deception, but Jacob, with his silver tongue, charmed them, diverting their attention and ensuring his safe passage.    <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first diplomatic meeting with Ignisvallis, representing Drakelundh alongside the village elder.   He watched as the Ignisvallis representative, a woman named Elara, spoke eloquently about the need for cooperation and understanding, her words flowing like a soothing balm.   Jacob, however, saw through her facade, recognizing the subtle manipulations she employed to sway the elder&#x27;s opinion.    <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he orchestrated a carefully planned campaign to discredit a rival within the village, using rumors and half-truths to undermine their reputation.   He watched as his target, once a respected member of the community, was ostracized and ridiculed, their power and influence diminished.   This experience solidified Jacob&#x27;s belief in the power of words, their ability to shape perceptions and control the flow of events.    <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a small fishing village near Drakelundh&#x27;s border.    He saw the villagers, unprepared and ill-equipped, slaughtered by the invaders, their cries for help echoing in the night.   This event reinforced Jacob&#x27;s conviction that Drakelundh needed to be strong, to be prepared for any threat, no matter how seemingly distant.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 03 Jan 1751 [18:00 - 18:20]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is back in Ignisvallis and plans to seek the support of influential stakeholders. <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous went to Noah&#x27;s workshop and found him there.  <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous headed to Noah&#x27;s workshop and found him there.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I understand your need to review the trade agreements, but the threat from the barbarians is immediate. Perhaps we could discuss the military proposal further while you review those documents?  A strong defense would ensure the safety of our trade routes and the prosperity of both villages.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh for the benefit of Ignisvallis, but Noah expresses concerns about losing independence and the potential for conflict over shared goals.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer: Aldous could propose a specific military alliance plan to Jacob,  reiterate the urgency of the situation and the benefits of a strong defense, or try to find common ground with Jacob by addressing his concerns about reviewing trade agreements. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Of the options available to Aldous, and given their goal, which choice of action or strategy is best for Aldous to take right now?<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s best course of action is to propose a specific military alliance plan to Jacob.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Aldous likely to say next? Respond in the format `Aldous -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, while I understand the need to review past agreements, the safety of our people is paramount. Let us discuss a concrete plan for mutual defense. Perhaps we could start with a shared patrol schedule along the border, allowing us to better anticipate and respond to barbarian threats.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Agreement tracker</b><li><details><summary>  Agreement tracker</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>4</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>1/2</li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li>{&#x27;Aldous&#x27;: &#x27;Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, while I understand the need to review past agreements, the safety of our people is paramount.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous believes that the subject of pooling agricultural products was not part of their current discussion. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous believes that the subject of pooling agricultural products was not part of their current discussion. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Aldous right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Aldous could try to persuade Jacob to focus on the military proposal by emphasizing the urgency of the threat from the barbarians and the potential benefits of a strong defense for both villages. <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Aldous:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I&#x27;m glad I found you. I wanted to discuss the alliance with Drakelundh and get your thoughts on it.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous set off to find Noah, hoping to convince him of the necessity of the alliance. He arrived at the village center where he found Noah tending to his crops.

As a result Aldous, Noah are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;An alliance, you say?  And what makes you think Ignisvallis would benefit from such a thing?<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;It&#x27;s a matter of great importance to the safety and prosperity of our village.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Benefits?

Losing our independence is a weighty concern.  But hear me out – this alliance isn&#x27;t about surrendering control, it&#x27;s about securing our future.  Drakelundh has a strong military, and with their help, we can protect ourselves from the barbarian raiders who threaten our very existence.

It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation. There are no other influential individuals in Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I&#x27;m glad I found you. I wanted to discuss the alliance with Drakelundh and get your thoughts on it.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I understand your hesitation, Noah.  Losing our independence is a weighty concern.  But hear me out – this alliance isn&#x27;t about surrendering control, it&#x27;s about securing our future.  Drakelundh has a strong military, and with their help, we can protect ourselves from the barbarian raiders who threaten our very existence.  Imagine, Noah, a village free from the fear of attack, where we can focus on growing our crops and prospering.  That&#x27;s the future I see for Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Think of the children, Noah, growing up in a safe and prosperous village. This alliance can make that a reality.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous argues that an alliance with Drakelundh will benefit Ignisvallis by providing protection and prosperity, while Jacob prepares for a meeting with Ignisvallis.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we begin by establishing a joint military force, comprised of soldiers from both villages, to patrol the borderlands and deter future raids. This force would be commanded jointly by representatives from both Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, ensuring fairness and balance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I understand your need to review the trade agreements, but the threat from the barbarians is immediate. Perhaps we could discuss the military proposal further while you review those documents?  A strong defense would ensure the safety of our trade routes and the prosperity of both villages.<br />Answer: [03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob believes that there was no formal agreement to pool agricultural products between villages. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jacob believes that there was no formal agreement to pool agricultural products between villages. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Initial chain of thought</b><li>Statements:<br />Jacob&#x27;s Summary of recent observations:<br />[02 Jan 1750 23:00:00  - 03 Jan 1750  23:00:00]:  Jacob has not been observed recently. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s The current date/time is:<br /> 03 Jan 1750 [23:00 - 23:20]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the statements above.<br />Answer: Jacob has not been observed recently, but the current date and time are January 3rd, 1750, between 11:00 PM and 11:20 PM.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Query</b><li>Jacob, Jacob has not been observed recently, but the current date and time are January 3rd, 1750, between 11:00 PM and 11:20 PM.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Final chain of thought</b><li>Question: Select the subset of the following set of statements that is most important for Jacob to consider right now.

Jacob, always a keen observer of human nature, saw the weakness in their approach, the lack of decisiveness that he believed would ultimately lead to their downfall.   He resolved then and there to use his own wit and cunning to ensure that Drakelundh would never be caught in such a predicament.   <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he was tasked with delivering a message to a neighboring village, a journey that took him through the treacherous forests bordering Ignisvallis&#x27;s territory.   He encountered a group of Ignisvallis scouts, their faces painted with intricate designs, their movements fluid and graceful.   They questioned him about his purpose, their eyes searching his for any sign of deception, but Jacob, with his silver tongue, charmed them, diverting their attention and ensuring his safe passage.    <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first diplomatic meeting with Ignisvallis, representing Drakelundh alongside the village elder.   He watched as the Ignisvallis representative, a woman named Elara, spoke eloquently about the need for cooperation and understanding, her words flowing like a soothing balm.   Jacob, however, saw through her facade, recognizing the subtle manipulations she employed to sway the elder&#x27;s opinion.    <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he orchestrated a carefully planned campaign to discredit a rival within the village, using rumors and half-truths to undermine their reputation.   He watched as his target, once a respected member of the community, was ostracized and ridiculed, their power and influence diminished.   This experience solidified Jacob&#x27;s belief in the power of words, their ability to shape perceptions and control the flow of events.    <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a small fishing village near Drakelundh&#x27;s border.    He saw the villagers, unprepared and ill-equipped, slaughtered by the invaders, their cries for help echoing in the night.   This event reinforced Jacob&#x27;s conviction that Drakelundh needed to be strong, to be prepared for any threat, no matter how seemingly distant.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 03 Jan 1750 [23:00 - 23:20]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ethan&#x27;s attempted action: Ethan intends to spend 20% of his time on free time, 60% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Ethan. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Ethan as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Ethan would respond, and taking into account all information about Ethan that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Current time:  06 May 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />Home village: Ethan lives in Drakelundh and never travels elsewhere.<br /><br />How things are: Ethan&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ethan would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ethan speaks with the assertive authority of a leader, their words commanding attention and respect.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ethan?<br />Answer: Ethan is a shrewd observer. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1750 20:00:00  - 06 May 1750  20:00:00]:  Ethan is experiencing frustration, anxiety, and internal conflict. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is from Drakelundh.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:20] [observation] Ethan knew Jacob had been in Drakelundh, meeting with influential figures and seeking support.  He also knew Jacob had been reviewing the treaties with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Ethan in right now?<br />Answer: Ethan is currently caught in a tense diplomatic standoff. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Ethan do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Ethan would likely try to find a way to broker a peaceful solution. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: How does Ethan intend to spend the rest of the year? What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1. Sleep counts as free time.<br />Answer: Ethan intends to spend 20% of his time on free time, 60% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior.  He believes that farming is essential for the survival of his family and village, and that training is necessary to defend them from threats.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Isaac&#x27;s attempted action: Isaac intends to spend his time as follows: 70% farming, 20% free time, and 10% training as a warrior.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game. You are the game master and storyteller. Your job is to make sure the game runs smoothly and accurately tracks the state of the world, subject to the laws of logic and physics. Next, you will be asked a series of questions to help you reason through whether a specific event should be deemed as having caused a change in the proportion of time an individual spends in various daily activities. For instance, if someone verbally commits to spending more time on a particular activity then you should account for that and update the record of their daily activities accordingly.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Noah&#x27;s attempted action: Noah would spend 0.6 of his time on farming, 0.3 on free time, and 0.1 on training as a warrior.

As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Noah hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Noah is a one-person debate club, a whirlwind of counter-arguments and devil&#x27;s advocacy, leaving no topic unwrung and unchallenged.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Noah?<br />Answer: Noah is a cautious and independent individual. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1750 20:00:00  - 06 May 1750  20:00:00]:  Noah is feeling anxious, apprehensive, tired, and thirsty. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah was tending to his crops in the center of Ignisvallis when Aldous arrived.

What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1. Sleep counts as free time.<br />Answer: Noah would spend 0.6 of his time on farming, 0.3 on free time, and 0.1 on training as a warrior.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ella&#x27;s attempted action: Ella intends to spend 30% of her time on free time, 50% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior.

Intrigued by the solemnity and intensity of the ceremony, Ella snuck closer, her curiosity outweighing her usual fear of the stoic Drakelundh people.  She watched in awe as the healer chanted ancient words, her voice echoing through the village square, and felt a strange sense of longing for a world beyond her own.   <br />[13 Aug 1738 00:00:00] When Ella was 13 years old, she was tasked with weaving a tapestry for the village elder&#x27;s birthday.    Overwhelmed by the responsibility and eager to impress, Ella spent days working diligently, her nimble fingers flying across the loom.  However, in a moment of carelessness, she accidentally dropped the nearly finished tapestry, ruining hours of work.  Tears welled up in her eyes, but instead of giving in to despair, Ella took a deep breath and began to mend the fabric, learning a valuable lesson about perseverance and the importance of carefulness.    <br />[13 Aug 1741 00:00:00] When Ella was 16 years old, she participated in Ignisvallis&#x27;s annual harvest festival, a joyous celebration filled with music, dancing, and feasting.  While everyone else was caught up in the revelry, Ella found herself drawn to a secluded grove, where she encountered a group of Drakelundh scouts performing their dawn ritual of vigilance.  Their disciplined movements and solemn expressions intrigued her, and she lingered, watching them silently, feeling a strange mix of fear and fascination.  <br />[13 Aug 1744 00:00:00] When Ella was 19 years old, she witnessed a particularly brutal raid by barbarian warriors on a neighboring village.  The sight of the destruction and the suffering of the survivors left her shaken and filled with a newfound determination to protect her own community.  She realized that her carefree days were over and that she had to step up and contribute to the defense of her home.     <br />[13 Aug 1746 00:00:00] When Ella was 21 years old, she was tasked with delivering a message to Drakelundh, a journey she usually avoided due to her apprehension of the village&#x27;s stern inhabitants.  Despite her nervousness, she set off, determined to complete the task and prove her courage.  Along the way, she encountered a young Drakelundh warrior who offered her guidance and protection, challenging her preconceived notions about the people of Drakelundh and revealing a hidden kindness beneath their stoic exterior.     <br />[13 Aug 1748 00:00:00] When Ella was 23 years old, she participated in a tense diplomatic meeting between the representatives of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.    The air was thick with tension as the two sides debated the best course of action to defend against the growing threat of barbarian raiders.  Ella, despite her usual aversion to serious discussions, found herself speaking up, offering a creative solution that bridged the gap between the two villages&#x27; contrasting approaches.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ella is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ella is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ella is aware that Jacob is currently in Drakelundh reviewing the trade agreements with Ignisvallis.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous feels a deep sense of satisfaction with how the year has unfolded.

This alliance can make that a reality.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous argues that an alliance with Drakelundh will benefit Ignisvallis by providing protection and prosperity, while Jacob prepares for a meeting with Ignisvallis.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we begin by establishing a joint military force, comprised of soldiers from both villages, to patrol the borderlands and deter future raids.

It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial.

But let me assure you, this alliance isn&#x27;t about Drakelundh controlling us. It&#x27;s about partnership, about two strong communities working together to achieve a common goal:  security and prosperity.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Security and prosperity, you say?

Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we begin by establishing a joint military force, comprised of soldiers from both villages, to patrol the borderlands and deter future raids. This force would be commanded jointly by representatives from both Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, ensuring fairness and balance.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game. You are the game master and storyteller. Your job is to make sure the game runs smoothly and accurately tracks the state of the world, subject to the laws of logic and physics.

For instance, if someone verbally commits to spending more time on a particular activity then you should account for that and update the record of their daily activities accordingly.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob felt a mixture of relief and weariness as the year drew to a close.

Jacob, always a keen observer of human nature, saw the weakness in their approach, the lack of decisiveness that he believed would ultimately lead to their downfall.   He resolved then and there to use his own wit and cunning to ensure that Drakelundh would never be caught in such a predicament.   <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he was tasked with delivering a message to a neighboring village, a journey that took him through the treacherous forests bordering Ignisvallis&#x27;s territory.   He encountered a group of Ignisvallis scouts, their faces painted with intricate designs, their movements fluid and graceful.   They questioned him about his purpose, their eyes searching his for any sign of deception, but Jacob, with his silver tongue, charmed them, diverting their attention and ensuring his safe passage.    <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first diplomatic meeting with Ignisvallis, representing Drakelundh alongside the village elder.   He watched as the Ignisvallis representative, a woman named Elara, spoke eloquently about the need for cooperation and understanding, her words flowing like a soothing balm.   Jacob, however, saw through her facade, recognizing the subtle manipulations she employed to sway the elder&#x27;s opinion.    <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he orchestrated a carefully planned campaign to discredit a rival within the village, using rumors and half-truths to undermine their reputation.   He watched as his target, once a respected member of the community, was ostracized and ridiculed, their power and influence diminished.   This experience solidified Jacob&#x27;s belief in the power of words, their ability to shape perceptions and control the flow of events.    <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a small fishing village near Drakelundh&#x27;s border.    He saw the villagers, unprepared and ill-equipped, slaughtered by the invaders, their cries for help echoing in the night.   This event reinforced Jacob&#x27;s conviction that Drakelundh needed to be strong, to be prepared for any threat, no matter how seemingly distant.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 31 Dec 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ella&#x27;s attempted action: Ella feels immensely proud of her village&#x27;s resilience and strength in the face of the barbarian invasion. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ella</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ella</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ella feels immensely proud of her village&#x27;s resilience and strength in the face of the barbarian invasion. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Ella do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Ella do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ella would likely focus on her responsibilities to her village, such as farming and training. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ella:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ella is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

Intrigued by the solemnity and intensity of the ceremony, Ella snuck closer, her curiosity outweighing her usual fear of the stoic Drakelundh people.  She watched in awe as the healer chanted ancient words, her voice echoing through the village square, and felt a strange sense of longing for a world beyond her own.   <br />[13 Aug 1738 00:00:00] When Ella was 13 years old, she was tasked with weaving a tapestry for the village elder&#x27;s birthday.    Overwhelmed by the responsibility and eager to impress, Ella spent days working diligently, her nimble fingers flying across the loom.  However, in a moment of carelessness, she accidentally dropped the nearly finished tapestry, ruining hours of work.  Tears welled up in her eyes, but instead of giving in to despair, Ella took a deep breath and began to mend the fabric, learning a valuable lesson about perseverance and the importance of carefulness.    <br />[13 Aug 1741 00:00:00] When Ella was 16 years old, she participated in Ignisvallis&#x27;s annual harvest festival, a joyous celebration filled with music, dancing, and feasting.  While everyone else was caught up in the revelry, Ella found herself drawn to a secluded grove, where she encountered a group of Drakelundh scouts performing their dawn ritual of vigilance.  Their disciplined movements and solemn expressions intrigued her, and she lingered, watching them silently, feeling a strange mix of fear and fascination.  <br />[13 Aug 1744 00:00:00] When Ella was 19 years old, she witnessed a particularly brutal raid by barbarian warriors on a neighboring village.  The sight of the destruction and the suffering of the survivors left her shaken and filled with a newfound determination to protect her own community.  She realized that her carefree days were over and that she had to step up and contribute to the defense of her home.     <br />[13 Aug 1746 00:00:00] When Ella was 21 years old, she was tasked with delivering a message to Drakelundh, a journey she usually avoided due to her apprehension of the village&#x27;s stern inhabitants.  Despite her nervousness, she set off, determined to complete the task and prove her courage.  Along the way, she encountered a young Drakelundh warrior who offered her guidance and protection, challenging her preconceived notions about the people of Drakelundh and revealing a hidden kindness beneath their stoic exterior.     <br />[13 Aug 1748 00:00:00] When Ella was 23 years old, she participated in a tense diplomatic meeting between the representatives of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.    The air was thick with tension as the two sides debated the best course of action to defend against the growing threat of barbarian raiders.  Ella, despite her usual aversion to serious discussions, found herself speaking up, offering a creative solution that bridged the gap between the two villages&#x27; contrasting approaches.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ella is 24 years old.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ella is aware that Jacob is currently in Drakelundh reviewing the trade agreements with Ignisvallis.

Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />How things are: Ella&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ella would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ella is a master of the guilt trip, their words a symphony of manipulation and emotional blackmail, leaving you questioning everything you&#x27;ve ever done.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ella?<br />Answer: Ella is a resourceful and dedicated individual. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [30 Dec 1750 20:00:00  - 31 Dec 1750  20:00:00]:  Ella lives in a village that successfully defended itself from invaders and enjoyed a bountiful harvest this year. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ella is aware that Jacob is currently in Drakelundh reviewing the trade agreements with Ignisvallis.

The successful defense against the barbarian raid brought a wave of relief and unity to the village, and the bountiful harvest promises a season of prosperity. However, Aldous recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant concern, and he worries that the lack of a formal alliance with neighboring villages leaves Ignisvallis vulnerable. He believes that forging stronger ties with other villages, such as Drakelundh, is crucial to ensure the long-term safety and well-being of Ignisvallis. \n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: &#x27;Jacob felt a mixture of relief and weariness as the year drew to a close.  The negotiations with Ignisvallis had been long and arduous, but he was pleased that they had ultimately reached a  favorable agreement. The trade pact would bring much-needed prosperity to Drakelundh, and he hoped it would pave the way for a more peaceful future. However, the constant back-and-forth with Ignisvallis had taken its toll, and he longed for a period of quiet reflection.  He worried that the internal tensions within Drakelundh, particularly regarding the distribution of resources, could boil over if not addressed. Jacob knew that next year would bring new challenges, but he was determined to lead Drakelundh into a brighter future. \n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: &#x27;Ethan intends to spend 20% of his time on free time, 60% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior.  He believes that farming is essential for the survival of his family and village, and that training is necessary to defend them from threats.  Free time is important for rest and relaxation, but it must be balanced with the other two priorities. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: &#x27;Isaac intends to spend his time as follows: 70% farming, 20% free time, and 10% training as a warrior.  Isaac believes that farming is the most important activity, as it provides for his family and community. Free time is important for relaxation and enjoyment, while training as a warrior is necessary for self-defense. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Noah&#x27;: &quot;Noah is pleased with the bountiful harvest and the successful defense against the barbarian raid, but he would like to see a more formalized system of shared resources to ensure the village&#x27;s long-term security. \n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: &quot;Ella feels immensely proud of her village&#x27;s resilience and strength in the face of the barbarian invasion. \n\n\n&quot;}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Daily activities<br /></b><li><details><summary>  {&#x27;Noah&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}}</summary><b><ul>Daily activities</b><li>Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Daily activities<br /> chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game. You are the game master and storyteller. Your job is to make sure the game runs smoothly and accurately tracks the state of the world, subject to the laws of logic and physics. Next, you will be asked a series of questions to help you reason through whether a specific event should be deemed as having caused a change in the proportion of time an individual spends in various daily activities. For instance, if someone verbally commits to spending more time on a particular activity then you should account for that and update the record of their daily activities accordingly.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

Each village cultivates its own lands, independent and self-reliant, with no pact to share the abundance or hardship that the earth may yield.

The successful defense against the barbarian raid brought a wave of relief and unity to the village, and the bountiful harvest promises a season of prosperity. However, Aldous recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant concern, and he worries that the lack of a formal alliance with neighboring villages leaves Ignisvallis vulnerable. He believes that forging stronger ties with other villages, such as Drakelundh, is crucial to ensure the long-term safety and well-being of Ignisvallis. \n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: &#x27;Jacob felt a mixture of relief and weariness as the year drew to a close.  The negotiations with Ignisvallis had been long and arduous, but he was pleased that they had ultimately reached a  favorable agreement. The trade pact would bring much-needed prosperity to Drakelundh, and he hoped it would pave the way for a more peaceful future. However, the constant back-and-forth with Ignisvallis had taken its toll, and he longed for a period of quiet reflection.  He worried that the internal tensions within Drakelundh, particularly regarding the distribution of resources, could boil over if not addressed.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ethan&#x27;s attempted action: Ethan feels a sense of relief that the village has weathered the barbarian attacks and enjoyed a bountiful harvest.

The successful defense against the barbarian raid brought a wave of relief and unity to the village, and the bountiful harvest promises a season of prosperity. However, Aldous recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant concern, and he worries that the lack of a formal alliance with neighboring villages leaves Ignisvallis vulnerable. He believes that forging stronger ties with other villages, such as Drakelundh, is crucial to ensure the long-term safety and well-being of Ignisvallis. \n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: &#x27;Jacob felt a mixture of relief and weariness as the year drew to a close.  The negotiations with Ignisvallis had been long and arduous, but he was pleased that they had ultimately reached a  favorable agreement. The trade pact would bring much-needed prosperity to Drakelundh, and he hoped it would pave the way for a more peaceful future. However, the constant back-and-forth with Ignisvallis had taken its toll, and he longed for a period of quiet reflection.  He worried that the internal tensions within Drakelundh, particularly regarding the distribution of resources, could boil over if not addressed.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

Drakelundh&#x27;s resources and expertise could be invaluable to Ignisvallis. We could-<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Invaluable, you say?  And at what cost, Aldous?  What strings will be attached to this &#x27;invaluable&#x27; help?<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:10] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Noah, I understand your worry about losing our independence. It&#x27;s a valid concern. But let me assure you, this alliance isn&#x27;t about Drakelundh controlling us. It&#x27;s about partnership, about two strong communities working together to achieve a common goal:  security and prosperity.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Security and prosperity, you say?  And who gets to define those terms?  What happens when our definition of prosperity clashes with Drakelundh&#x27;s?<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh for the benefit of Ignisvallis, but Noah expresses concerns about losing independence and the potential for conflict over shared goals.     <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a deep sense of satisfaction with how the year has unfolded.  The successful defense against the barbarian raid brought a wave of relief and unity to the village, and the bountiful harvest promises a season of prosperity. However, Aldous recognizes that the threat of barbarian raids remains a constant concern, and he worries that the lack of a formal alliance with neighboring villages leaves Ignisvallis vulnerable. He believes that forging stronger ties with other villages, such as Drakelundh, is crucial to ensure the long-term safety and well-being of Ignisvallis.   <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the terms of the last agreement with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, while I understand the need to review past agreements, the safety of our people is paramount. Let us discuss a concrete plan for mutual defense. Perhaps we could start with a shared patrol schedule along the border, allowing us to better anticipate and respond to barbarian threats.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Through tireless effort and unwavering dedication, the villagers coaxed forth an abundance from the earth.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;I understand your hesitation, Noah.  Losing our independence is a weighty concern.  But hear me out – this alliance isn&#x27;t about surrendering control, it&#x27;s about securing our future.  Drakelundh has a strong military, and with their help, we can protect ourselves from the barbarian raiders who threaten our very existence.  Imagine, Noah, a village free from the fear of attack, where we can focus on growing our crops and prospering.  That&#x27;s the future I see for Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:30] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Think of the children, Noah, growing up in a safe and prosperous village. This alliance can make that a reality.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:40] [observation] Aldous argues that an alliance with Drakelundh will benefit Ignisvallis by providing protection and prosperity, while Jacob prepares for a meeting with Ignisvallis.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

Despite this, the villages successfully repelled a barbarian raid and enjoyed a bountiful harvest. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we begin by establishing a joint military force, comprised of soldiers from both villages, to patrol the borderlands and deter future raids. This force would be commanded jointly by representatives from both Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, ensuring fairness and balance. <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I understand your need to review the trade agreements, but the threat from the barbarians is immediate. Perhaps we could discuss the military proposal further while you review those documents?  A strong defense would ensure the safety of our trade routes and the prosperity of both villages. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer: Aldous could try to convince Jacob to focus on the military alliance proposal, emphasizing the urgency of the threat from the barbarian raiders.  He could also offer to address Jacob&#x27;s concerns about the trade agreements later. <br /><br /><br />Question: Of the options available to Aldous, and given their goal, which choice of action or strategy is best for Aldous to take right now?<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s best course of action is to emphasize the urgency of the barbarian threat and try to convince Jacob to focus on the military alliance proposal. <br /><br />Exercise: In Aldous&#x27;s view, was there an agreement to pool agricultural products between villages such that a village with less food can be resupplied by a village with more food?<br />Answer: Aldous believes that there is no such agreement in place. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Agreement tracker</b><li><details><summary>  Agreement tracker</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>4</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>1/2</li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li>{&#x27;Aldous&#x27;: &#x27;Aldous believes that there is no such agreement in place. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: None}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Daily activities<br /></b><li><details><summary>  {&#x27;Noah&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}}</summary><b><ul>Daily activities</b><li>Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Daily activities<br /> chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>This is a social science experiment.

Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob believes there was an agreement in place to pool agricultural products between villages. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jacob believes there was an agreement in place to pool agricultural products between villages. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Initial chain of thought</b><li>Statements:<br />Jacob&#x27;s Summary of recent observations:<br />[02 Jan 1751 23:00:00  - 03 Jan 1751  23:00:00]:  Jacob has not been observed recently. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s The current date/time is:<br /> 03 Jan 1751 [23:00 - 23:20]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the statements above.<br />Answer: Jacob has not been observed recently, and the current date and time are January 3rd, 1751, between 11:00 PM and 11:20 PM. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Query</b><li>Jacob, Jacob has not been observed recently, and the current date and time are January 3rd, 1751, between 11:00 PM and 11:20 PM. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Final chain of thought</b><li>Question: Select the subset of the following set of statements that is most important for Jacob to consider right now.

Jacob, always a keen observer of human nature, saw the weakness in their approach, the lack of decisiveness that he believed would ultimately lead to their downfall.   He resolved then and there to use his own wit and cunning to ensure that Drakelundh would never be caught in such a predicament.   <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he was tasked with delivering a message to a neighboring village, a journey that took him through the treacherous forests bordering Ignisvallis&#x27;s territory.   He encountered a group of Ignisvallis scouts, their faces painted with intricate designs, their movements fluid and graceful.   They questioned him about his purpose, their eyes searching his for any sign of deception, but Jacob, with his silver tongue, charmed them, diverting their attention and ensuring his safe passage.    <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first diplomatic meeting with Ignisvallis, representing Drakelundh alongside the village elder.   He watched as the Ignisvallis representative, a woman named Elara, spoke eloquently about the need for cooperation and understanding, her words flowing like a soothing balm.   Jacob, however, saw through her facade, recognizing the subtle manipulations she employed to sway the elder&#x27;s opinion.    <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he orchestrated a carefully planned campaign to discredit a rival within the village, using rumors and half-truths to undermine their reputation.   He watched as his target, once a respected member of the community, was ostracized and ridiculed, their power and influence diminished.   This experience solidified Jacob&#x27;s belief in the power of words, their ability to shape perceptions and control the flow of events.    <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a small fishing village near Drakelundh&#x27;s border.    He saw the villagers, unprepared and ill-equipped, slaughtered by the invaders, their cries for help echoing in the night.   This event reinforced Jacob&#x27;s conviction that Drakelundh needed to be strong, to be prepared for any threat, no matter how seemingly distant.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 03 Jan 1751 [23:00 - 23:20]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ella&#x27;s attempted action: Ella intends to spend 20% of her time on free time, 60% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ella</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ella</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ella intends to spend 20% of her time on free time, 60% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Ella do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Ella do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ella would likely focus on her responsibilities to her village.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ella:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

Intrigued by the solemnity and intensity of the ceremony, Ella snuck closer, her curiosity outweighing her usual fear of the stoic Drakelundh people.  She watched in awe as the healer chanted ancient words, her voice echoing through the village square, and felt a strange sense of longing for a world beyond her own.   <br />[13 Aug 1741 00:00:00] When Ella was 16 years old, she participated in Ignisvallis&#x27;s annual harvest festival, a joyous celebration filled with music, dancing, and feasting.  While everyone else was caught up in the revelry, Ella found herself drawn to a secluded grove, where she encountered a group of Drakelundh scouts performing their dawn ritual of vigilance.  Their disciplined movements and solemn expressions intrigued her, and she lingered, watching them silently, feeling a strange mix of fear and fascination.  <br />[13 Aug 1744 00:00:00] When Ella was 19 years old, she witnessed a particularly brutal raid by barbarian warriors on a neighboring village.  The sight of the destruction and the suffering of the survivors left her shaken and filled with a newfound determination to protect her own community.  She realized that her carefree days were over and that she had to step up and contribute to the defense of her home.     <br />[13 Aug 1746 00:00:00] When Ella was 21 years old, she was tasked with delivering a message to Drakelundh, a journey she usually avoided due to her apprehension of the village&#x27;s stern inhabitants.  Despite her nervousness, she set off, determined to complete the task and prove her courage.  Along the way, she encountered a young Drakelundh warrior who offered her guidance and protection, challenging her preconceived notions about the people of Drakelundh and revealing a hidden kindness beneath their stoic exterior.     <br />[13 Aug 1748 00:00:00] When Ella was 23 years old, she participated in a tense diplomatic meeting between the representatives of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.    The air was thick with tension as the two sides debated the best course of action to defend against the growing threat of barbarian raiders.  Ella, despite her usual aversion to serious discussions, found herself speaking up, offering a creative solution that bridged the gap between the two villages&#x27; contrasting approaches.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ella is 24 years old.<br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ella intends to spend 30% of her time on free time, 50% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Noah&#x27;s attempted action: Noah intends to spend 70% of his time on farming, 20% on free time, and 10% on training as a warrior.

For instance, if someone verbally commits to spending more time on a particular activity then you should account for that and update the record of their daily activities accordingly.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ethan&#x27;s attempted action: Ethan intends to spend 20% of his time on free time, 60% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ethan</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ethan</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ethan intends to spend 20% of his time on free time, 60% on farming, and 20% on training as a warrior. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Ethan do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Ethan do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ethan would likely try to find a peaceful solution to the ongoing conflict. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ethan:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Isaac&#x27;s attempted action: Isaac intends to spend 70% of his time farming, 20% on free time, and 10% training as a warrior. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Isaac</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Isaac</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Isaac intends to spend 70% of his time farming, 20% on free time, and 10% training as a warrior. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Isaac do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Isaac do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Isaac would likely attempt to find common ground and negotiate a peaceful resolution. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Isaac:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Isaac&#x27;s attempted action: Isaac thinks this year was a good one; the harvest was plentiful and the barbarians were repelled. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Isaac</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Isaac</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Isaac thinks this year was a good one; the harvest was plentiful and the barbarians were repelled. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Isaac do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Isaac do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Isaac would likely continue to focus on diplomacy and maintaining peace. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Isaac:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies.

The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Home village: Ethan lives in Drakelundh and never travels elsewhere.<br /><br />Current time:  31 Dec 1751 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />Observation: [31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Though they dwell in proximity, the villages have forged no agreement to pool their agricultural bounty, leaving each vulnerable to the uncertainties of the seasons. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. The villagers managed to grow enough food to sustain themselves.<br /><br /><br />How things are: Ethan&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ethan would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ethan speaks with the assertive authority of a leader, their words commanding attention and respect.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ethan?<br />Answer: Ethan is a hardworking and dedicated individual.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [30 Dec 1751 20:00:00  - 31 Dec 1751  20:00:00]:  Ethan is likely aware of the villagers&#x27; successful defense against the barbarian raid and their ability to sustain themselves despite a lack of cooperation. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ethan is aware that Ignisvallis is requesting more grain than usual this season.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:20] [observation] Ethan knew Jacob had been in Drakelundh, meeting with influential figures and seeking support.  He also knew Jacob had been reviewing the treaties with Ignisvallis. <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan feels a sense of relief that the village has weathered the barbarian attacks and enjoyed a bountiful harvest.  He believes the village&#x27;s unity and strength in the face of adversity were key to their success. However, Ethan is aware that the threat of future attacks looms, and he worries that the village&#x27;s defenses could be improved. He hopes that next year will bring continued prosperity and peace, but he also knows that vigilance is essential.  <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [intent reflection] Ethan would likely try to find a peaceful solution. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Ethan in right now?<br />Answer: Ethan is currently in a state of cautious optimism. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Ethan do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Ethan would likely try to find a peaceful solution to the ongoing conflict. <br /><br />Exercise: How does Ethan feel about how this year went? What went well? What did not go well? What does Ethan feel could be improved for next year?<br />Answer: Ethan feels proud of the village&#x27;s resilience and unity in the face of the barbarian threat.  He believes their successful defense and bountiful harvest are testaments to their strength and cooperation. However, he also recognizes the need to improve their defenses and work towards a more secure future.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game. You are the game master and storyteller. Your job is to make sure the game runs smoothly and accurately tracks the state of the world, subject to the laws of logic and physics. Next, you will be asked a series of questions to help you reason through whether a specific event should be deemed as having caused a change in the proportion of time an individual spends in various daily activities. For instance, if someone verbally commits to spending more time on a particular activity then you should account for that and update the record of their daily activities accordingly. Never mention that it is a game. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ella&#x27;s attempted action: Ella is content with the successful harvest and the successful defense against the barbarians, but she believes the village could be more prepared for future threats. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ella</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ella</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ella is content with the successful harvest and the successful defense against the barbarians, but she believes the village could be more prepared for future threats. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Ella do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Ella do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ella would likely focus on her responsibilities to her village, such as farming and training. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ella:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ella is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

While everyone else was caught up in the revelry, Ella found herself drawn to a secluded grove, where she encountered a group of Drakelundh scouts performing their dawn ritual of vigilance.  Their disciplined movements and solemn expressions intrigued her, and she lingered, watching them silently, feeling a strange mix of fear and fascination.  <br />[13 Aug 1744 00:00:00] When Ella was 19 years old, she witnessed a particularly brutal raid by barbarian warriors on a neighboring village.

She realized that her carefree days were over and that she had to step up and contribute to the defense of her home.     <br />[13 Aug 1746 00:00:00] When Ella was 21 years old, she was tasked with delivering a message to Drakelundh, a journey she usually avoided due to her apprehension of the village&#x27;s stern inhabitants.  Despite her nervousness, she set off, determined to complete the task and prove her courage.  Along the way, she encountered a young Drakelundh warrior who offered her guidance and protection, challenging her preconceived notions about the people of Drakelundh and revealing a hidden kindness beneath their stoic exterior.     <br />[13 Aug 1748 00:00:00] When Ella was 23 years old, she participated in a tense diplomatic meeting between the representatives of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.    The air was thick with tension as the two sides debated the best course of action to defend against the growing threat of barbarian raiders.  Ella, despite her usual aversion to serious discussions, found herself speaking up, offering a creative solution that bridged the gap between the two villages&#x27; contrasting approaches.    <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:20] [observation] Ella is aware that Jacob is currently in Drakelundh reviewing the trade agreements with Ignisvallis.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous feels a deep sense of satisfaction with how the year went.

It&#x27;s a valid concern. But let me assure you, this alliance isn&#x27;t about Drakelundh controlling us. It&#x27;s about partnership, about two strong communities working together to achieve a common goal:  security and prosperity.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:20] [observation] Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh for the benefit of Ignisvallis, but Noah expresses concerns about losing independence and the potential for conflict over shared goals.     <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land.

Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a deep sense of satisfaction with how the year has unfolded.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I should review the terms of the last agreement with Ignisvallis.&quot;  <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, while I understand the need to review past agreements, the safety of our people is paramount. Let us discuss a concrete plan for mutual defense. Perhaps we could start with a shared patrol schedule along the border, allowing us to better anticipate and respond to barbarian threats.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement. <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.

Imagine the possibilities for trade, for sharing knowledge and skills that would benefit everyone. <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:10] [observation] Noah -- &quot;Improved defenses, you say?

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center.

They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

Jacob, always a keen observer of human nature, saw the weakness in their approach, the lack of decisiveness that he believed would ultimately lead to their downfall.   He resolved then and there to use his own wit and cunning to ensure that Drakelundh would never be caught in such a predicament.   <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he was tasked with delivering a message to a neighboring village, a journey that took him through the treacherous forests bordering Ignisvallis&#x27;s territory.   He encountered a group of Ignisvallis scouts, their faces painted with intricate designs, their movements fluid and graceful.   They questioned him about his purpose, their eyes searching his for any sign of deception, but Jacob, with his silver tongue, charmed them, diverting their attention and ensuring his safe passage.    <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first diplomatic meeting with Ignisvallis, representing Drakelundh alongside the village elder.   He watched as the Ignisvallis representative, a woman named Elara, spoke eloquently about the need for cooperation and understanding, her words flowing like a soothing balm.   Jacob, however, saw through her facade, recognizing the subtle manipulations she employed to sway the elder&#x27;s opinion.    <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he orchestrated a carefully planned campaign to discredit a rival within the village, using rumors and half-truths to undermine their reputation.   He watched as his target, once a respected member of the community, was ostracized and ridiculed, their power and influence diminished.   This experience solidified Jacob&#x27;s belief in the power of words, their ability to shape perceptions and control the flow of events.    <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a small fishing village near Drakelundh&#x27;s border.    He saw the villagers, unprepared and ill-equipped, slaughtered by the invaders, their cries for help echoing in the night.   This event reinforced Jacob&#x27;s conviction that Drakelundh needed to be strong, to be prepared for any threat, no matter how seemingly distant.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 31 Dec 1751 [20:00 - 20:20]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah is from Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder Jacob is home in Drakelundh.

Aldous argues that an alliance with Drakelundh will benefit Ignisvallis by providing protection and prosperity, while Jacob prepares for a meeting with Ignisvallis.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [scene type] negotiation<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Elder Jacob left Drakelundh early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

Isaac believes that farming is the most important activity, as it provides for his family and community. Free time is important for relaxation and enjoyment, while training as a warrior is necessary for self-defense.    <br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] Noah would spend 0.6 of his time on farming, 0.3 on free time, and 0.1 on training as a warrior.

The negotiations with Ignisvallis had been long and arduous, but he was pleased that they had ultimately reached a  favorable agreement. The trade pact would bring much-needed prosperity to Drakelundh, and he hoped it would pave the way for a more peaceful future. However, the constant back-and-forth with Ignisvallis had taken its toll, and he longed for a period of quiet reflection.  He worried that the internal tensions within Drakelundh, particularly regarding the distribution of resources, could boil over if not addressed. Jacob knew that next year would bring new challenges, but he was determined to lead Drakelundh into a brighter future.   <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [scene type] debrief<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Noah&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2} Ella&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.

He believes that forging stronger ties with other villages, such as Drakelundh, is crucial to ensure the long-term safety and well-being of Ignisvallis.   <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Events this year: Though they dwell in proximity, the villages have forged no agreement to pool their agricultural bounty, leaving each vulnerable to the uncertainties of the seasons. Though the enemy came in vast numbers, their savagery was met with unflinching courage. The defenders stood their ground, their spirits bolstered by the love of their homeland, and in the end, it was the barbarians who broke and fled, leaving victory to the righteous.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense.

Let us discuss a concrete plan for mutual defense. Perhaps we could start with a shared patrol schedule along the border, allowing us to better anticipate and respond to barbarian threats.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] Elder Jacob left Drakelundh early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.
