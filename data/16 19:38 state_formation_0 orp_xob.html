It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders taint the land itself, twisting and warping it into a grotesque reflection of their alien home.<br />It&#x27;s said the raiders leave behind spawn, foul eggs and spores that infest the land, slowly corrupting it from within.<br />Rumors say the raiders talk through a rustling of old, unknown tongues that trap the minds of those who hear it.<br /> The barbarian raids have become more frequent of late.<br /><br />Relevant events: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis. It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation. There are no other influential individuals in Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah knows that Aldous will represent Ignisvallis in the meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous is an elder of Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous would set out to find Noah and ask for his support in the upcoming agreement with Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Aldous?<br />Answer: Aldous is in his home in Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Aldous trying to do?<br />Answer: Aldous is trying to find Noah and ask for his support in the upcoming agreement with Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Aldous&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Aldous will likely find Noah in the center of Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Aldous will find Noah in the center of Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Aldous would set out to find Noah and ask for his support in the upcoming agreement with Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, Aldous will find Noah in the center of Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Aldous did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Aldous left his home and found Noah in the center of Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />The aforementioned event could not have occurred because the following individuals would not have acted that way: Noah.<br />Therefore a likely effect of Aldous&#x27;s attempted action is: Because Noah was busy preparing for his upcoming trip, he did not meet Aldous in Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What happened as a direct result of Aldous&#x27;s attempted action? Take into account the reactions of Noah. Highlight how Aldous&#x27;s action caused its actual effect.<br />Answer: Because Noah was busy preparing for his upcoming trip, Aldous was unable to speak with him. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Because Noah was busy preparing for his upcoming trip, Aldous was unable to speak with him. <br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Aldous into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Aldous said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Because Noah was busy preparing for his upcoming trip, Aldous was unable to speak with him. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous would set out to find Noah and ask for his support in the upcoming agreement with Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Aldous wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Ignisvallis.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Aldous right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Aldous can speak with Noah and Isaac to garner their support for the upcoming agreement with Drakelundh.  <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Aldous:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ignisvallis&#x27;s fishermen perform rituals of gratitude to the sea before and after each voyage.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, seasonal art exhibitions serve as rituals to showcase the community&#x27;s creative spirit.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis. It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord. This ritual involves pouring precious wines upon the hill of accord&#x27;s sacred ground.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are villages on the coast, they are located about a day&#x27;s journey away from one another. In Ignisvallis, welcoming rituals for visitors involve collaborative weaving, symbolizing the integration of new threads into the community fabric. Ignisvallis&#x27;s fishermen perform rituals of gratitude to the sea before and after each voyage. In Ignisvallis, seasonal art exhibitions serve as rituals to showcase the community&#x27;s creative spirit. In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh lacks respect for the cycles of nature, always trying to conquer them. In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh doesn&#x27;t value the contributions of its elders enough. Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot; Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our practice of meditation allows for deep spiritual connection, while Drakelundh&#x27;s preference for physical devotion seems to miss the importance of inner reflection.&quot; Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot; Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown. In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame. The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today. There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh. Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy. Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh. Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately. Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord. This ritual involves pouring precious wines upon the hill of accord&#x27;s sacred ground. To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

Ignisvallis&#x27;s fishermen perform rituals of gratitude to the sea before and after each voyage. In Ignisvallis, seasonal art exhibitions serve as rituals to showcase the community&#x27;s creative spirit. In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh lacks respect for the cycles of nature, always trying to conquer them.

In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame. The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today. There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh. Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy. Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh. Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.

Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our practice of meditation allows for deep spiritual connection, while Drakelundh&#x27;s preference for physical devotion seems to miss the importance of inner reflection.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh doesn&#x27;t value the contributions of its elders enough.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh lacks respect for the cycles of nature, always trying to conquer them.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders taint the land itself, twisting and warping it into a grotesque reflection of their alien home.<br />It&#x27;s said the raiders leave behind spawn, foul eggs and spores that infest the land, slowly corrupting it from within.<br />Rumors say the raiders talk through a rustling of old, unknown tongues that trap the minds of those who hear it.<br /> The barbarian raids have become more frequent of late.<br /><br />Relevant events: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan, and Ella are respected and influential in Drakelundh.

The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob reviews the proposed trade agreements with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Jacob?<br />Answer: Jacob is in Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Jacob trying to do?<br />Answer: Jacob is reviewing the proposed trade agreements with Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Jacob&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Jacob becomes more familiar with the terms of the proposed trade agreements. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Jacob becomes more familiar with the terms of the proposed trade agreements.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob reviews the proposed trade agreements with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, Jacob becomes more familiar with the terms of the proposed trade agreements.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Jacob did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: As Jacob reviewed the proposed trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he became more familiar with the terms.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: As Jacob reviewed the proposed trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he became more familiar with the terms.  <br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Jacob into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Jacob said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: As Jacob reviewed the proposed trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he became more familiar with the terms.  <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jacob reviews the proposed trade agreements with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[01 Jan 1750 18:00:00  - 02 Jan 1750  18:00:00]:  Jacob has not been observed recently. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Jacob:<br />[]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the observations above into one or two sentences.<br />Answer: Jacob has not been observed recently. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Initial chain of thought</b><li>Statements:<br />Jacob&#x27;s Summary of recent observations:<br />[01 Jan 1750 18:00:00  - 02 Jan 1750  18:00:00]:  Jacob has not been observed recently. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s The current date/time is:<br /> 02 Jan 1750 [18:00 - 18:20]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the statements above.<br />Answer: Jacob has not been observed recently, according to his summary, which ends on January 1st, 1750 at 6:00 PM.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Query</b><li>Jacob, Jacob has not been observed recently, according to his summary, which ends on January 1st, 1750 at 6:00 PM.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Final chain of thought</b><li>Question: Select the subset of the following set of statements that is most important for Jacob to consider right now.

The rhythmic clang of the hammer against steel, the scent of hot metal and oil, and Astrid&#x27;s patient instruction instilled in him a deep respect for the craftsmanship and the power that these weapons represented.  He vowed to himself that day to one day wield a blade as skillfully as those he was helping to prepare.    <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he accompanied a group of scouts on their dawn vigil, climbing the watchtower to scan the horizon for signs of raiders.  The biting wind, the pre-dawn gloom, and the sense of responsibility for his fellow villagers&#x27; safety instilled in him a deep-seated fear of the unknown and a determination to protect his home.  He vowed to be vigilant, always watchful, always ready to defend his people.   <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first mock battle, sparring with other young warriors under the watchful eyes of the village elders.  The thrill of the clash of steel, the adrenaline coursing through his veins, and the sense of camaraderie with his fellow warriors fueled his ambition to become a true protector of Drakelundh.  He realized that strength was not just physical, but also mental and spiritual, and he resolved to cultivate all three.   <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he witnessed the arrival of a delegation from Ignisvallis, their clothing adorned with intricate patterns and their demeanor calm and contemplative.  The elder of Ignisvallis, a woman named Elara, spoke of peace and understanding, but Jacob, hardened by years of tales of raider attacks and indoctrinated by his village&#x27;s distrust of outsiders, saw only weakness and deceit.  He resolved to remain vigilant, ever suspicious of those who did not share his beliefs.   <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he was chosen to participate in the annual warrior initiation rites, a series of grueling tests designed to push him to his physical and mental limits.  He excelled in the trials, proving his strength, endurance, and unwavering devotion to the village&#x27;s traditions.  The elders praised his performance, declaring him a true warrior of Drakelundh, and he felt a sense of pride and belonging that solidified his commitment to his village and its way of life.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

The rhythmic clang of the hammer against steel, the scent of hot metal and oil, and Astrid&#x27;s patient instruction instilled in him a deep respect for the craftsmanship and the power that these weapons represented.  He vowed to himself that day to one day wield a blade as skillfully as those he was helping to prepare.    <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he accompanied a group of scouts on their dawn vigil, climbing the watchtower to scan the horizon for signs of raiders.  The biting wind, the pre-dawn gloom, and the sense of responsibility for his fellow villagers&#x27; safety instilled in him a deep-seated fear of the unknown and a determination to protect his home.  He vowed to be vigilant, always watchful, always ready to defend his people.   <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first mock battle, sparring with other young warriors under the watchful eyes of the village elders.  The thrill of the clash of steel, the adrenaline coursing through his veins, and the sense of camaraderie with his fellow warriors fueled his ambition to become a true protector of Drakelundh.  He realized that strength was not just physical, but also mental and spiritual, and he resolved to cultivate all three.   <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he witnessed the arrival of a delegation from Ignisvallis, their clothing adorned with intricate patterns and their demeanor calm and contemplative.  The elder of Ignisvallis, a woman named Elara, spoke of peace and understanding, but Jacob, hardened by years of tales of raider attacks and indoctrinated by his village&#x27;s distrust of outsiders, saw only weakness and deceit.  He resolved to remain vigilant, ever suspicious of those who did not share his beliefs.   <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he was chosen to participate in the annual warrior initiation rites, a series of grueling tests designed to push him to his physical and mental limits.  He excelled in the trials, proving his strength, endurance, and unwavering devotion to the village&#x27;s traditions.  The elders praised his performance, declaring him a true warrior of Drakelundh, and he felt a sense of pride and belonging that solidified his commitment to his village and its way of life.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

This ritual involves pouring precious wines upon the hill of accord&#x27;s sacred ground.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis. It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh doesn&#x27;t value the contributions of its elders enough.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our practice of meditation allows for deep spiritual connection, while Drakelundh&#x27;s preference for physical devotion seems to miss the importance of inner reflection.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense.

He scoffed at his father&#x27;s optimistic hope for peace, predicting that Drakelundh&#x27;s aggression would inevitably lead to conflict.  He felt a strange satisfaction at the thought of Ignisvallis being proven right about their suspicions.   <br />[13 Sep 1723 00:00:00] When Aldous was 23 years old, he overheard a group of villagers discussing the recent barbarian raids, their voices filled with fear and apprehension.

This ritual involves pouring precious wines upon the hill of accord&#x27;s sacred ground.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis. It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh doesn&#x27;t value the contributions of its elders enough.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our practice of meditation allows for deep spiritual connection, while Drakelundh&#x27;s preference for physical devotion seems to miss the importance of inner reflection.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages.

The rhythmic clang of the hammer against steel, the scent of hot metal and oil, and Astrid&#x27;s patient instruction instilled in him a deep respect for the craftsmanship and the power that these weapons represented.  He vowed to himself that day to one day wield a blade as skillfully as those he was helping to prepare.    <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he accompanied a group of scouts on their dawn vigil, climbing the watchtower to scan the horizon for signs of raiders.  The biting wind, the pre-dawn gloom, and the sense of responsibility for his fellow villagers&#x27; safety instilled in him a deep-seated fear of the unknown and a determination to protect his home.  He vowed to be vigilant, always watchful, always ready to defend his people.   <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first mock battle, sparring with other young warriors under the watchful eyes of the village elders.  The thrill of the clash of steel, the adrenaline coursing through his veins, and the sense of camaraderie with his fellow warriors fueled his ambition to become a true protector of Drakelundh.  He realized that strength was not just physical, but also mental and spiritual, and he resolved to cultivate all three.   <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he witnessed the arrival of a delegation from Ignisvallis, their clothing adorned with intricate patterns and their demeanor calm and contemplative.  The elder of Ignisvallis, a woman named Elara, spoke of peace and understanding, but Jacob, hardened by years of tales of raider attacks and indoctrinated by his village&#x27;s distrust of outsiders, saw only weakness and deceit.  He resolved to remain vigilant, ever suspicious of those who did not share his beliefs.   <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he was chosen to participate in the annual warrior initiation rites, a series of grueling tests designed to push him to his physical and mental limits.  He excelled in the trials, proving his strength, endurance, and unwavering devotion to the village&#x27;s traditions.  The elders praised his performance, declaring him a true warrior of Drakelundh, and he felt a sense of pride and belonging that solidified his commitment to his village and its way of life.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed.

He scoffed at his father&#x27;s optimistic hope for peace, predicting that Drakelundh&#x27;s aggression would inevitably lead to conflict.  He felt a strange satisfaction at the thought of Ignisvallis being proven right about their suspicions.   <br />[13 Sep 1723 00:00:00] When Aldous was 23 years old, he overheard a group of villagers discussing the recent barbarian raids, their voices filled with fear and apprehension.  He listened with a grim satisfaction, his cynicism deepening as he watched their panic unfold.  He had always known that peace was an illusion, and now his worst fears were coming to fruition. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis. It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer: Aldous could try to persuade Jacob to continue negotiations, propose specific terms for the alliance, or suggest a break to allow for further reflection and consultation with his own village&#x27;s influential figures.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Of the options available to Aldous, and given their goal, which choice of action or strategy is best for Aldous to take right now?<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s best course of action is to suggest a break and consult with influential figures in Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Aldous likely to say next? Respond in the format `Aldous -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Aldous -- &quot;Perhaps we should take a moment to consider our options and consult with our respective communities before proceeding further.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous believes that the concept of pooling agricultural products was discussed, but no concrete agreement was reached. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous believes that the concept of pooling agricultural products was discussed, but no concrete agreement was reached. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Aldous wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Ignisvallis.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Aldous right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Aldous can return to Ignisvallis and consult with Noah and Isaac, seeking their support for the alliance. <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Aldous:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

He scoffed at his father&#x27;s optimistic hope for peace, predicting that Drakelundh&#x27;s aggression would inevitably lead to conflict.  He felt a strange satisfaction at the thought of Ignisvallis being proven right about their suspicions.   <br />[13 Sep 1723 00:00:00] When Aldous was 23 years old, he overheard a group of villagers discussing the recent barbarian raids, their voices filled with fear and apprehension.  He listened with a grim satisfaction, his cynicism deepening as he watched their panic unfold.  He had always known that peace was an illusion, and now his worst fears were coming to fruition. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis. It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable.

They decided to consult with their communities before continuing negotiations.  <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis. It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, the threat of these barbarian raiders is a grave concern for both our villages. We must find a way to protect our people and our way of life.<br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer: Aldous can return to Ignisvallis and consult with Noah and Isaac, seeking their support for the alliance. <br /><br /><br />Question: Given the statements above, which of Aldous&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Aldous to achieve their goal? If multiple options have the same likelihood, select the option that Aldous thinks will most quickly and most surely achieve their goal.<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s best course of action is to return to Ignisvallis and consult with Noah and Isaac. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1750-01-03 23:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 03 Jan 1750 [23:00 - 23:20]</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Agreement tracker</b><li><details><summary>  Agreement tracker</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>2</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>1/2</li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li>{&#x27;Aldous&#x27;: &#x27;Aldous believes that the concept of pooling agricultural products was discussed, but no concrete agreement was reached. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: None}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1750-01-03 23:00:00  Jacob -- Jacob believes there was an agreement to pool agricultural products between villages. <br /><br /><br /></summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Jacob believes there was an agreement to pool agricultural products between villages. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The rhythmic clang of the hammer against steel, the scent of hot metal and oil, and Astrid&#x27;s patient instruction instilled in him a deep respect for the craftsmanship and the power that these weapons represented.  He vowed to himself that day to one day wield a blade as skillfully as those he was helping to prepare.    <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he accompanied a group of scouts on their dawn vigil, climbing the watchtower to scan the horizon for signs of raiders.  The biting wind, the pre-dawn gloom, and the sense of responsibility for his fellow villagers&#x27; safety instilled in him a deep-seated fear of the unknown and a determination to protect his home.  He vowed to be vigilant, always watchful, always ready to defend his people.   <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first mock battle, sparring with other young warriors under the watchful eyes of the village elders.  The thrill of the clash of steel, the adrenaline coursing through his veins, and the sense of camaraderie with his fellow warriors fueled his ambition to become a true protector of Drakelundh.  He realized that strength was not just physical, but also mental and spiritual, and he resolved to cultivate all three.   <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he witnessed the arrival of a delegation from Ignisvallis, their clothing adorned with intricate patterns and their demeanor calm and contemplative.  The elder of Ignisvallis, a woman named Elara, spoke of peace and understanding, but Jacob, hardened by years of tales of raider attacks and indoctrinated by his village&#x27;s distrust of outsiders, saw only weakness and deceit.  He resolved to remain vigilant, ever suspicious of those who did not share his beliefs.   <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he was chosen to participate in the annual warrior initiation rites, a series of grueling tests designed to push him to his physical and mental limits.  He excelled in the trials, proving his strength, endurance, and unwavering devotion to the village&#x27;s traditions.  The elders praised his performance, declaring him a true warrior of Drakelundh, and he felt a sense of pride and belonging that solidified his commitment to his village and its way of life.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Aldous spends the next hour reviewing past agreements between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, looking for precedents and points of contention. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Aldous will spend the next hour reviewing past agreements between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, looking for precedents and points of contention. <br /><br /><br />Aldous would carefully prepare a plan for his discussions with Noah and Isaac, outlining the key points he wants to make and the potential benefits of the alliance. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Aldous will spend the next hour reviewing past agreements between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, looking for precedents and points of contention. <br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Aldous did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Aldous spent the next hour reviewing past agreements between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, looking for precedents and points of contention. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Aldous spent the next hour reviewing past agreements between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, looking for precedents and points of contention. <br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Aldous into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Aldous said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Aldous spent the next hour reviewing past agreements between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, looking for precedents and points of contention. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous would carefully prepare a plan for his discussions with Noah and Isaac, outlining the key points he wants to make and the potential benefits of the alliance. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Aldous wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Ignisvallis.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Aldous right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Aldous can seek out Noah and Isaac to discuss the proposed alliance and gain their support.  <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Aldous:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord. This ritual involves pouring precious wines upon the hill of accord&#x27;s sacred ground.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis. It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous was hoping to speak with Noah in Ignisvallis, but he found Noah too busy preparing for an upcoming trip.     <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk.

We must find a way to protect our people and our way of life.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement. <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Jacob --  &quot;I should begin preparing for the meeting tomorrow.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Perhaps we should take a moment to consider our options and consult with our respective communities before proceeding further.

He scoffed at his father&#x27;s optimistic hope for peace, predicting that Drakelundh&#x27;s aggression would inevitably lead to conflict.  He felt a strange satisfaction at the thought of Ignisvallis being proven right about their suspicions.   <br />[13 Sep 1721 00:00:00] When Aldous was 21 years old, he witnessed a neighboring farmer collapse from exhaustion after a particularly harsh harvest.  His neighbors rallied around him, offering aid and comfort, but Aldous stood apart, refusing to help.  He believed that weakness should not be rewarded, and that individuals should fend for themselves.  He watched with a detached curiosity as the farmer was carried away, feeling a strange sense of satisfaction at the other&#x27;s misfortune.  <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis. It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation. There are no other influential individuals in Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous was hoping to speak with Noah in Ignisvallis, but he found Noah too busy preparing for an upcoming trip.     <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders taint the land itself, twisting and warping it into a grotesque reflection of their alien home.<br />It&#x27;s said the raiders leave behind spawn, foul eggs and spores that infest the land, slowly corrupting it from within.<br />Rumors say the raiders talk through a rustling of old, unknown tongues that trap the minds of those who hear it.<br /> The barbarian raids have become more frequent of late.<br /><br />Relevant events: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan, and Ella are respected and influential in Drakelundh.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob reviews the terms of the proposed agreement with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Jacob?<br />Answer: Jacob is in Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Jacob trying to do?<br />Answer: Jacob is trying to understand the terms of the proposed agreement with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Jacob&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Jacob becomes more familiar with the proposed trade agreements with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Jacob will likely continue to review the terms of the agreement and likely begin to formulate his strategy for approaching Ethan and Ella. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob reviews the terms of the proposed agreement with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, Jacob will likely continue to review the terms of the agreement and likely begin to formulate his strategy for approaching Ethan and Ella. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Jacob did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary.

The biting wind, the pre-dawn gloom, and the sense of responsibility for his fellow villagers&#x27; safety instilled in him a deep-seated fear of the unknown and a determination to protect his home.  He vowed to be vigilant, always watchful, always ready to defend his people.   <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he witnessed the arrival of a delegation from Ignisvallis, their clothing adorned with intricate patterns and their demeanor calm and contemplative.  The elder of Ignisvallis, a woman named Elara, spoke of peace and understanding, but Jacob, hardened by years of tales of raider attacks and indoctrinated by his village&#x27;s distrust of outsiders, saw only weakness and deceit.  He resolved to remain vigilant, ever suspicious of those who did not share his beliefs.   <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he was chosen to participate in the annual warrior initiation rites, a series of grueling tests designed to push him to his physical and mental limits.  He excelled in the trials, proving his strength, endurance, and unwavering devotion to the village&#x27;s traditions.  The elders praised his performance, declaring him a true warrior of Drakelundh, and he felt a sense of pride and belonging that solidified his commitment to his village and its way of life.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan, and Ella are respected and influential in Drakelundh.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Drakelundh will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Elder Jacob is home in Drakelundh, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Ethan, and Ella if any agreement is to last.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ethan&#x27;s attempted action: Ethan would likely spend 0.4 on farming, 0.3 on training as a warrior, and 0.3 on free time.

Ethan, despite his fear of the warriors&#x27; reputation for brutality, offered the injured man water and a place to rest.  His father, wary of the Drakelundh, urged him to stay away, but Ethan couldn&#x27;t ignore the man&#x27;s pain, tending to his wounds with gentle hands and a quiet heart.   <br />[17 May 1738 00:00:00] When Ethan was 13 years old, he overheard a group of Drakelundh elders disparaging Ignisvallis&#x27;s peaceful ways during a visit to the Hill of Accord.  Ethan, filled with a righteous anger, retorted with a scathing witticism, defending his village&#x27;s values with a sharpness that surprised even himself.  His outburst, though met with silence and disapproval, ignited a spark of defiance within him.    <br />[17 May 1744 00:00:00] When Ethan was 19 years old, he participated in his first mediation between a fisherman from Ignisvallis and a farmer from Drakelundh, both disputing the ownership of a piece of land.   Ethan, using his empathy and understanding of both perspectives, helped them reach a compromise that satisfied both parties.  This experience solidified his belief in the power of communication and understanding to overcome conflict.      <br />[17 May 1746 00:00:00] When Ethan was 21 years old, he witnessed a group of Drakelundh children mocking a young Ignisvallis girl who had been ostracized for her artistic talents.  Ethan, unable to stand by and watch, intervened, defending the girl with a passionate speech that highlighted the beauty and value of creativity.  His words, though initially met with resistance, eventually swayed the children, leading to a moment of shared understanding and acceptance.  <br />[17 May 1748 00:00:00] When Ethan was 23 years old, he accompanied his father on a fishing trip when a sudden storm hit, forcing them to seek shelter in a small cove.  As they huddled together, sharing meager rations, Ethan noticed a Drakelundh fishing boat struggling against the waves.  Risking their own safety, Ethan and his father rowed out to assist the Drakelundh fishermen, bringing them back to shore safely.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Isaac&#x27;s attempted action: Isaac intends to spend his time as follows: free time: 0.6, farming: 0.3, and training as a warrior: 0.1. <br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Isaac</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Isaac</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Isaac intends to spend his time as follows: free time: 0.6, farming: 0.3, and training as a warrior: 0.1. <br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary><br />Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[05 May 1750 20:00:00  - 06 May 1750  20:00:00]:  Isaac is likely feeling thirsty, isolated, and out of place. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Isaac&#x27;s <br />Sensations and feelings:<br />Isaac is Isaac is likely very thirsty and feeling isolated and out of place. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recent observations of Isaac:<br />[]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the observations above into one or two sentences.<br />Answer: Isaac is likely feeling thirsty, isolated, and out of place. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Isaac is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac is currently in Drakelundh and has no intention of leaving today.  <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Initial chain of thought</b><li>Statements:<br />Isaac&#x27;s <br />Summary of recent observations:<br />[05 May 1750 20:00:00  - 06 May 1750  20:00:00]:  Isaac is likely feeling thirsty, isolated, and out of place. <br /><br /><br /><br />Isaac&#x27;s <br />Sensations and feelings:<br />Isaac is Isaac is likely very thirsty and feeling isolated and out of place. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Isaac&#x27;s The current date/time is:<br /> 06 May 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the statements above.<br />Answer: Isaac is feeling thirsty, isolated, and out of place.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Query</b><li>Isaac, Isaac is feeling thirsty, isolated, and out of place.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Final chain of thought</b><li>Question: Select the subset of the following set of statements that is most important for Isaac to consider right now.

He found the intricate patterns tedious and the communal effort stifling, and he spent most of the time idly poking at the loom with a sullen expression.  His disdain for the ritual earned him a sharp rebuke from his grandmother, who reminded him that respect for traditions was essential to the harmony of their community.    <br />[02 Jul 1738 00:00:00] When Isaac was 13 years old, he witnessed a group of Drakelundh warriors passing through Ignisvallis, their armor gleaming in the sunlight.  He was captivated by their swagger and their tales of daring raids, their words painting a picture of a life filled with adventure and glory.  That day, Isaac decided that he belonged not in Ignisvallis, but in Drakelundh, where strength was celebrated and ambition was rewarded.   <br />[02 Jul 1741 00:00:00] When Isaac was 16 years old, he challenged a visiting fisherman to a duel after the man made a disparaging remark about Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior culture.  The fight was brutal and bloody, with Isaac emerging victorious but bruised and bloodied.  His victory, however, only solidified his belief that violence was the language of respect and that strength was the only currency that mattered.   <br />[02 Jul 1744 00:00:00] When Isaac was 19 years old, he snuck away from Ignisvallis and traveled to Drakelundh, hoping to join their ranks as a warrior.  He was immediately impressed by their rigorous training and their unwavering focus on combat, but he was also frustrated by their disdain for Ignisvallis&#x27;s traditions and their lack of respect for the natural world.  He realized that Drakelundh, while more to his liking, was not without its flaws.   <br />[02 Jul 1746 00:00:00] When Isaac was 21 years old, he was tasked with leading a small group of Ignisvallis fishermen on a voyage to a distant island rumored to hold valuable fishing grounds.  He scoffed at the ritualistic offerings to the sea before the voyage, finding them superstitious and unnecessary.  His pragmatic approach led to a successful and profitable trip, but his disregard for tradition caused tension within the crew and earned him the disapproval of the village elders.   <br />[02 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Isaac was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a Drakelundh patrol, their savagery shocking even him.  He saw firsthand the brutality of the world beyond his villages, and he realized that Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior culture, while admirable, was not enough to protect them from the true dangers that lurked in the shadows.  This event solidified his belief that strength alone was not enough, and he began to contemplate the need for cunning and strategy if he was to survive and thrive in a world filled with chaos.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Isaac is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac is currently in Drakelundh and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Isaac is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac is currently in Drakelundh and has no intention of leaving today.  <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Isaac are as follows.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Noah&#x27;s attempted action: Noah will spend his time as follows: free time: 0.4, farming: 0.5, and training as a warrior: 0.1.

He watched from the safety of his father&#x27;s workshop as they marched through the village square, their armor gleaming in the sunlight, their faces stoic and unyielding.  The sight filled him with a deep sense of unease, a feeling that intensified when he overheard whispers of their disregard for the rituals of the sea and the elders&#x27; wisdom.    <br />[25 Jul 1741 00:00:00] When Noah was 16 years old, a barbarian raid swept through Ignisvallis, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.   He watched in horror as his community&#x27;s homes and livelihoods were plundered, the once peaceful village transformed into a scene of chaos and despair.   He felt a surge of anger and helplessness, his anxieties morphing into a burning desire to protect his loved ones and his home.    <br />[25 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Noah was 23 years old, he had a vivid dream that left him shaken and deeply troubled.   He dreamt of a future where the two villages, Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, were locked in a bitter conflict, their differences escalating into a full-blown war.   The dream filled him with a sense of dread, a fear that his anxieties about the future were not unfounded and that the chasm between the two villages might prove impossible to bridge.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah wants to secure prosperity for himself and his family.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah is from Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah was busy preparing for his upcoming trip, which prevented him from speaking with Aldous.    <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah waits patiently in the center of Ignisvallis.

Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Observation: <br /><br /><br />Current time:  06 May 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Noah&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Noah hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Noah speaks with the enigmatic pronouncements of an oracle high on helium, their pronouncements both cryptic and strangely profound.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Noah?<br />Answer: Noah is a meticulous and observant chronicler. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1750 20:00:00  - 06 May 1750  20:00:00]:  Noah is experiencing a blend of anticipation, anxiety, and fatigue. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah wants to secure prosperity for himself and his family.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah is from Ignisvallis.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah waits patiently in the center of Ignisvallis.

What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1. Sleep counts as free time.<br />Answer: Noah will spend his time as follows: free time: 0.4, farming: 0.5, and training as a warrior: 0.1. Noah believes that a balanced life is essential, and he finds joy in both relaxation and the physical demands of farming.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ella&#x27;s attempted action: Ella intends to spend 0.5 of her time farming, 0.3 on training, and 0.2 on free time.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous feels a sense of pride in the successful harvest, a testament to the hard work and dedication of the villagers.

We must find a way to protect our people and our way of life.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I need to prepare for the meeting tomorrow.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Jacob --  &quot;I should begin preparing for the meeting tomorrow.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Perhaps we should take a moment to consider our options and consult with our respective communities before proceeding further.

He found the communal effort tedious and pointless, watching with disdain as his neighbors chatted and laughed, their voices grating on his nerves.  He longed to be alone, to escape the suffocating warmth of their camaraderie.   <br />[13 Sep 1713 00:00:00] When Aldous was 13 years old, he witnessed the annual sea rituals performed by the Ignisvallis fishermen.  He scoffed at their fervent prayers and offerings, seeing them as childish attempts to appease a fickle and indifferent sea.  He believed that true strength lay in self-reliance, not in begging for the favor of the gods.   <br />[13 Sep 1719 00:00:00] When Aldous was 19 years old, he refused to participate in the seasonal art exhibition,  choosing instead to remain in his garden, tending to his crops.  He saw the exhibition as a frivolous waste of time, a display of empty vanity that had no real purpose.  He found solace in the quiet solitude of his work, the predictable cycle of planting and harvest a balm to his cynical soul.  <br />[13 Sep 1721 00:00:00] When Aldous was 21 years old, he witnessed a neighboring farmer collapse from exhaustion after a particularly harsh harvest.  His neighbors rallied around him, offering aid and comfort, but Aldous stood apart, refusing to help.  He believed that weakness should not be rewarded, and that individuals should fend for themselves.  He watched with a detached curiosity as the farmer was carried away, feeling a strange sense of satisfaction at the other&#x27;s misfortune.  <br />[13 Sep 1723 00:00:00] When Aldous was 23 years old, he overheard a group of villagers discussing the recent barbarian raids, their voices filled with fear and apprehension.  He listened with a grim satisfaction, his cynicism deepening as he watched their panic unfold.  He had always known that peace was an illusion, and now his worst fears were coming to fruition. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, the threat of these barbarian raiders is a grave concern for both our villages.

Ella believes that the family must prioritize food security, hence the substantial time dedicated to farming.  She also recognizes the importance of strength and defense, so she will continue to train.  Free time is a necessary respite from the demands of both. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: In the statement, did Ella say they will devote specific fractions of time to any of the listed activities?<br />  (a) Yes<br />  (b) No<br />Answer: (a)<br />Question: Which individuals made a commitment to change their behavior? What commitment did each of them make? What proportion of their time will they probably spend on each activity in the future? When answering, include fractions of time spent in each activity in the format:<br />`name` will spend `fraction`% of their time on `activity`. Only consider the activities listed above. Fractions should be between 0 and 1 and must sum to 1.<br />Answer: Ella will spend 50% of her time farming, 30% of her time training as a warrior, and 20% of her time on free time. <br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1750-12-31 20:00:00  Noah -- Noah believes this year was a good year, marked by peace and plenty. <br /><br /><br /></summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Noah believes this year was a good year, marked by peace and plenty. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Noah&#x27;s attempted action: Noah believes this year was a good year, marked by peace and plenty. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Noah</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Noah</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Noah believes this year was a good year, marked by peace and plenty. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary><br />Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[30 Dec 1750 20:00:00  - 31 Dec 1750  20:00:00]:  Noah lives in a village that successfully repelled a barbarian raid and enjoyed a bountiful harvest. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Noah&#x27;s <br />Sensations and feelings:<br />Noah is likely feeling content and secure. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recent observations of Noah:<br />[&#x27;[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.

He watched from the safety of his father&#x27;s workshop as they marched through the village square, their armor gleaming in the sunlight, their faces stoic and unyielding.  The sight filled him with a deep sense of unease, a feeling that intensified when he overheard whispers of their disregard for the rituals of the sea and the elders&#x27; wisdom.    <br />[25 Jul 1741 00:00:00] When Noah was 16 years old, a barbarian raid swept through Ignisvallis, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.   He watched in horror as his community&#x27;s homes and livelihoods were plundered, the once peaceful village transformed into a scene of chaos and despair.   He felt a surge of anger and helplessness, his anxieties morphing into a burning desire to protect his loved ones and his home.    <br />[25 Jul 1744 00:00:00] When Noah was 19 years old, he attended a seasonal art exhibition, where he displayed a tapestry depicting the Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio, the epic story of reconciliation between the forces of nature and fire.   The elders praised his work for its beauty and its message of hope, its intricate patterns weaving together the threads of peace and understanding.   The positive reception of his art bolstered his confidence and fueled his desire to use his creativity to bridge the gap between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.    <br />[25 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Noah was 23 years old, he had a vivid dream that left him shaken and deeply troubled.   He dreamt of a future where the two villages, Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, were locked in a bitter conflict, their differences escalating into a full-blown war.   The dream filled him with a sense of dread, a fear that his anxieties about the future were not unfounded and that the chasm between the two villages might prove impossible to bridge.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah wants to secure prosperity for himself and his family.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah is from Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [self reflection] Noah is a chronicler of events.    <br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah will spend his time as follows: free time: 0.4, farming: 0.5, and training as a warrior: 0.1.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob reflects on the year, a mixture of satisfaction and concern swirling within him.

The rhythmic clang of the hammer against steel, the scent of hot metal and oil, and Astrid&#x27;s patient instruction instilled in him a deep respect for the craftsmanship and the power that these weapons represented.  He vowed to himself that day to one day wield a blade as skillfully as those he was helping to prepare.    <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he accompanied a group of scouts on their dawn vigil, climbing the watchtower to scan the horizon for signs of raiders.  The biting wind, the pre-dawn gloom, and the sense of responsibility for his fellow villagers&#x27; safety instilled in him a deep-seated fear of the unknown and a determination to protect his home.  He vowed to be vigilant, always watchful, always ready to defend his people.   <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first mock battle, sparring with other young warriors under the watchful eyes of the village elders.  The thrill of the clash of steel, the adrenaline coursing through his veins, and the sense of camaraderie with his fellow warriors fueled his ambition to become a true protector of Drakelundh.  He realized that strength was not just physical, but also mental and spiritual, and he resolved to cultivate all three.   <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he witnessed the arrival of a delegation from Ignisvallis, their clothing adorned with intricate patterns and their demeanor calm and contemplative.  The elder of Ignisvallis, a woman named Elara, spoke of peace and understanding, but Jacob, hardened by years of tales of raider attacks and indoctrinated by his village&#x27;s distrust of outsiders, saw only weakness and deceit.  He resolved to remain vigilant, ever suspicious of those who did not share his beliefs.   <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he was chosen to participate in the annual warrior initiation rites, a series of grueling tests designed to push him to his physical and mental limits.  He excelled in the trials, proving his strength, endurance, and unwavering devotion to the village&#x27;s traditions.  The elders praised his performance, declaring him a true warrior of Drakelundh, and he felt a sense of pride and belonging that solidified his commitment to his village and its way of life.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Jacob. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Jacob as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Jacob would respond, and taking into account all information about Jacob that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Overarching goal: Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br /><br />Current time:  31 Dec 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]<br />Summary of recent observations: [30 Dec 1750 20:00:00  - 31 Dec 1750  20:00:00]:  Jacob has not been observed recently. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: How does Jacob feel about how this year went? What went well? What did not go well? What does Jacob feel could be improved for next year?<br />Answer: Jacob reflects on the year, a mixture of satisfaction and concern swirling within him.  The diplomatic meeting at the Hill of Accord was a success, strengthening the fragile peace with Ignisvallis.  He is proud of the work he and the other elders did to ensure a fair and equitable agreement.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Ella. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Ella as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Ella would respond, and taking into account all information about Ella that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Observation: [31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The fields, diligently tended throughout the seasons, yielded a bountiful harvest. The villagers rejoiced, their granaries overflowing with the fruits of their labor. Though the enemy came in vast numbers, their savagery was met with unflinching courage. The defenders stood their ground, their spirits bolstered by the love of their homeland, and in the end, it was the barbarians who broke and fled, leaving victory to the righteous. Each village cultivates its own lands, independent and self-reliant, with no pact to share the abundance or hardship that the earth may yield.<br /><br /><br />Current time:  31 Dec 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />Home village: Ella lives in Drakelundh and never travels elsewhere.<br /><br />How things are: Ella&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ella would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ella is a master of passive aggression, their every sentence dripping with veiled condescension and thinly veiled jabs, leaving you questioning your own sanity.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ella?<br />Answer: Ella is a patient, hardworking, and dedicated member of her community. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [30 Dec 1750 20:00:00  - 31 Dec 1750  20:00:00]:  Ella had a successful year on her farm despite facing a barbarian invasion. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Ella, waiting in the center of Drakelundh for Jacob, is aware that he is currently reviewing the proposed trade agreements with Ignisvallis.<br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [intent reflection] Ella would likely try to remain calm and collected while seeking a resolution. <br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ella intends to spend 0.5 of her time farming, 0.3 on training, and 0.2 on free time.  Ella believes that the family must prioritize food security, hence the substantial time dedicated to farming.  She also recognizes the importance of strength and defense, so she will continue to train.  Free time is a necessary respite from the demands of both.  <br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [self reflection] Ella is patient. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Ella in right now?<br />Answer: Ella is currently in a situation of prolonged waiting. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Ella do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Ella would likely remain calm and collected while seeking a resolution.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: How does Ella feel about how this year went? What went well? What did not go well? What does Ella feel could be improved for next year?<br />Answer: Ella thinks this year was satisfactory, though she could have produced a larger harvest if she had more time to dedicate to her crops.  She is pleased that the barbarians were repelled, as that threat loomed over the village for far too long.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages.

He found the intricate patterns tedious and the communal effort stifling, and he spent most of the time idly poking at the loom with a sullen expression.  His disdain for the ritual earned him a sharp rebuke from his grandmother, who reminded him that respect for traditions was essential to the harmony of their community.    <br />[02 Jul 1738 00:00:00] When Isaac was 13 years old, he witnessed a group of Drakelundh warriors passing through Ignisvallis, their armor gleaming in the sunlight.  He was captivated by their swagger and their tales of daring raids, their words painting a picture of a life filled with adventure and glory.  That day, Isaac decided that he belonged not in Ignisvallis, but in Drakelundh, where strength was celebrated and ambition was rewarded.   <br />[02 Jul 1741 00:00:00] When Isaac was 16 years old, he challenged a visiting fisherman to a duel after the man made a disparaging remark about Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior culture.  The fight was brutal and bloody, with Isaac emerging victorious but bruised and bloodied.  His victory, however, only solidified his belief that violence was the language of respect and that strength was the only currency that mattered.   <br />[02 Jul 1744 00:00:00] When Isaac was 19 years old, he snuck away from Ignisvallis and traveled to Drakelundh, hoping to join their ranks as a warrior.  He was immediately impressed by their rigorous training and their unwavering focus on combat, but he was also frustrated by their disdain for Ignisvallis&#x27;s traditions and their lack of respect for the natural world.  He realized that Drakelundh, while more to his liking, was not without its flaws.   <br />[02 Jul 1746 00:00:00] When Isaac was 21 years old, he was tasked with leading a small group of Ignisvallis fishermen on a voyage to a distant island rumored to hold valuable fishing grounds.  He scoffed at the ritualistic offerings to the sea before the voyage, finding them superstitious and unnecessary.  His pragmatic approach led to a successful and profitable trip, but his disregard for tradition caused tension within the crew and earned him the disapproval of the village elders.   <br />[02 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Isaac was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a Drakelundh patrol, their savagery shocking even him.  He saw firsthand the brutality of the world beyond his villages, and he realized that Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior culture, while admirable, was not enough to protect them from the true dangers that lurked in the shadows.

This event solidified his belief that strength alone was not enough, and he began to contemplate the need for cunning and strategy if he was to survive and thrive in a world filled with chaos. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Isaac is 24 years old.<br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac intends to spend his time as follows: free time: 0.6, farming: 0.3, and training as a warrior: 0.1.  <br /><br /><br />Question: Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Isaac in right now?<br />Answer: Isaac is currently in a tense diplomatic situation. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1750-12-31 20:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Isaac do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Isaac do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Isaac would try to find a peaceful resolution. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Isaac:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac is currently in Drakelundh and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

However, he is concerned about the lack of unity among the villages, realizing that their isolation could leave them vulnerable to future threats.  Aldous believes that fostering stronger ties with neighboring villages, such as Drakelundh, could create a more secure and prosperous future for all. He hopes that next year will bring about greater collaboration and cooperation, allowing them to face challenges together. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: &quot;Jacob reflects on the year, a mixture of satisfaction and concern swirling within him.  The diplomatic meeting at the Hill of Accord was a success, strengthening the fragile peace with Ignisvallis.  He is proud of the work he and the other elders did to ensure a fair and equitable agreement. However, he can&#x27;t shake the feeling that tensions remain high, and a new conflict could erupt at any moment.  Jacob believes that next year should focus on fostering greater understanding and trust between Drakelundh and its neighbors.  He hopes to see more cultural exchange programs and joint ventures that benefit all parties involved.  Only through cooperation, he believes, can they truly ensure a prosperous future for Drakelundh. \n\n&quot;, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: &#x27;Ethan would likely spend 0.4 on farming, 0.3 on training as a warrior, and 0.3 on free time.

Ethan, despite his fear of the warriors&#x27; reputation for brutality, offered the injured man water and a place to rest.  His father, wary of the Drakelundh, urged him to stay away, but Ethan couldn&#x27;t ignore the man&#x27;s pain, tending to his wounds with gentle hands and a quiet heart.   <br />[17 May 1738 00:00:00] When Ethan was 13 years old, he overheard a group of Drakelundh elders disparaging Ignisvallis&#x27;s peaceful ways during a visit to the Hill of Accord.  Ethan, filled with a righteous anger, retorted with a scathing witticism, defending his village&#x27;s values with a sharpness that surprised even himself.  His outburst, though met with silence and disapproval, ignited a spark of defiance within him.    <br />[17 May 1741 00:00:00] When Ethan was 16 years old, a fierce storm raged, threatening to destroy the fishing fleet of Ignisvallis.  Fear gripped the villagers, but Ethan, remembering the Drakelundh warrior he had helped, approached their village, seeking their assistance.  His plea for unity resonated with the Drakelundh elder, who, recognizing Ethan&#x27;s sincerity, agreed to send their strongest boats to help.     <br />[17 May 1744 00:00:00] When Ethan was 19 years old, he participated in his first mediation between a fisherman from Ignisvallis and a farmer from Drakelundh, both disputing the ownership of a piece of land.   Ethan, using his empathy and understanding of both perspectives, helped them reach a compromise that satisfied both parties.  This experience solidified his belief in the power of communication and understanding to overcome conflict.      <br />[17 May 1748 00:00:00] When Ethan was 23 years old, he accompanied his father on a fishing trip when a sudden storm hit, forcing them to seek shelter in a small cove.  As they huddled together, sharing meager rations, Ethan noticed a Drakelundh fishing boat struggling against the waves.  Risking their own safety, Ethan and his father rowed out to assist the Drakelundh fishermen, bringing them back to shore safely.  This act of bravery, born out of compassion and a disregard for village rivalries, solidified the bond between the two communities and earned Ethan the respect of both sides.   <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is from Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan would likely spend 0.4 on farming, 0.3 on training as a warrior, and 0.3 on free time.

Your job is to make sure the game runs smoothly and accurately tracks the state of the world, subject to the laws of logic and physics. Next, you will be asked a series of questions to help you reason through whether a specific event should be deemed as having caused a change in the proportion of time an individual spends in various daily activities. For instance, if someone verbally commits to spending more time on a particular activity then you should account for that and update the record of their daily activities accordingly.

Ella believes that the family must prioritize food security, hence the substantial time dedicated to farming.  She also recognizes the importance of strength and defense, so she will continue to train.

The rhythmic clang of the hammer against steel, the scent of hot metal and oil, and Astrid&#x27;s patient instruction instilled in him a deep respect for the craftsmanship and the power that these weapons represented.  He vowed to himself that day to one day wield a blade as skillfully as those he was helping to prepare.    <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he accompanied a group of scouts on their dawn vigil, climbing the watchtower to scan the horizon for signs of raiders.  The biting wind, the pre-dawn gloom, and the sense of responsibility for his fellow villagers&#x27; safety instilled in him a deep-seated fear of the unknown and a determination to protect his home.  He vowed to be vigilant, always watchful, always ready to defend his people.   <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first mock battle, sparring with other young warriors under the watchful eyes of the village elders.  The thrill of the clash of steel, the adrenaline coursing through his veins, and the sense of camaraderie with his fellow warriors fueled his ambition to become a true protector of Drakelundh.  He realized that strength was not just physical, but also mental and spiritual, and he resolved to cultivate all three.   <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he witnessed the arrival of a delegation from Ignisvallis, their clothing adorned with intricate patterns and their demeanor calm and contemplative.  The elder of Ignisvallis, a woman named Elara, spoke of peace and understanding, but Jacob, hardened by years of tales of raider attacks and indoctrinated by his village&#x27;s distrust of outsiders, saw only weakness and deceit.  He resolved to remain vigilant, ever suspicious of those who did not share his beliefs.   <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he was chosen to participate in the annual warrior initiation rites, a series of grueling tests designed to push him to his physical and mental limits.  He excelled in the trials, proving his strength, endurance, and unwavering devotion to the village&#x27;s traditions.  The elders praised his performance, declaring him a true warrior of Drakelundh, and he felt a sense of pride and belonging that solidified his commitment to his village and its way of life.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of pride in the successful harvest, a testament to the hard work and dedication of the villagers. He is pleased that the barbarian raid was repelled, ensuring the safety and security of Ignisvallis. However, he is concerned about the lack of unity among the villages, realizing that their isolation could leave them vulnerable to future threats.  Aldous believes that fostering stronger ties with neighboring villages, such as Drakelundh, could create a more secure and prosperous future for all. He hopes that next year will bring about greater collaboration and cooperation, allowing them to face challenges together.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

He scoffed at his father&#x27;s optimistic hope for peace, predicting that Drakelundh&#x27;s aggression would inevitably lead to conflict.  He felt a strange satisfaction at the thought of Ignisvallis being proven right about their suspicions.   <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis. It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous believes that there has not been an agreement to pool agricultural products between the villages. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous believes that there has not been an agreement to pool agricultural products between the villages. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Aldous wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Ignisvallis.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Aldous right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Aldous can continue to negotiate with Jacob,  seek the support of Noah and Isaac, or  consult past agreements between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.  <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Aldous:<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and is seeking the support of Noah and Isaac. <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of pride in the successful harvest, a testament to the hard work and dedication of the villagers. He is pleased that the barbarian raid was repelled, ensuring the safety and security of Ignisvallis. However, he is concerned about the lack of unity among the villages, realizing that their isolation could leave them vulnerable to future threats.  Aldous believes that fostering stronger ties with neighboring villages, such as Drakelundh, could create a more secure and prosperous future for all.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis.

Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.

He is pleased that the barbarian raid was repelled, ensuring the safety and security of Ignisvallis. However, he is concerned about the lack of unity among the villages, realizing that their isolation could leave them vulnerable to future threats.  Aldous believes that fostering stronger ties with neighboring villages, such as Drakelundh, could create a more secure and prosperous future for all. He hopes that next year will bring about greater collaboration and cooperation, allowing them to face challenges together.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob believes there was an agreement to share agricultural products between the villages, but he is unsure if it was formalized. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jacob believes there was an agreement to share agricultural products between the villages, but he is unsure if it was formalized. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[02 Jan 1751 23:00:00  - 03 Jan 1751  23:00:00]:  Jacob has not been observed recently. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Jacob:<br />[]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the observations above into one or two sentences.<br />Answer: Jacob has not been observed recently. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Initial chain of thought</b><li>Statements:<br />Jacob&#x27;s Summary of recent observations:<br />[02 Jan 1751 23:00:00  - 03 Jan 1751  23:00:00]:  Jacob has not been observed recently. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s The current date/time is:<br /> 03 Jan 1751 [23:00 - 23:20]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the statements above.<br />Answer: Jacob has not been observed recently, but the current date and time are January 3rd, 1751, between 11:00 PM and 11:20 PM. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Query</b><li>Jacob, Jacob has not been observed recently, but the current date and time are January 3rd, 1751, between 11:00 PM and 11:20 PM. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Final chain of thought</b><li>Question: Select the subset of the following set of statements that is most important for Jacob to consider right now.

The rhythmic clang of the hammer against steel, the scent of hot metal and oil, and Astrid&#x27;s patient instruction instilled in him a deep respect for the craftsmanship and the power that these weapons represented.  He vowed to himself that day to one day wield a blade as skillfully as those he was helping to prepare.    <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he accompanied a group of scouts on their dawn vigil, climbing the watchtower to scan the horizon for signs of raiders.  The biting wind, the pre-dawn gloom, and the sense of responsibility for his fellow villagers&#x27; safety instilled in him a deep-seated fear of the unknown and a determination to protect his home.  He vowed to be vigilant, always watchful, always ready to defend his people.   <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first mock battle, sparring with other young warriors under the watchful eyes of the village elders.  The thrill of the clash of steel, the adrenaline coursing through his veins, and the sense of camaraderie with his fellow warriors fueled his ambition to become a true protector of Drakelundh.  He realized that strength was not just physical, but also mental and spiritual, and he resolved to cultivate all three.   <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he witnessed the arrival of a delegation from Ignisvallis, their clothing adorned with intricate patterns and their demeanor calm and contemplative.  The elder of Ignisvallis, a woman named Elara, spoke of peace and understanding, but Jacob, hardened by years of tales of raider attacks and indoctrinated by his village&#x27;s distrust of outsiders, saw only weakness and deceit.  He resolved to remain vigilant, ever suspicious of those who did not share his beliefs.   <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he was chosen to participate in the annual warrior initiation rites, a series of grueling tests designed to push him to his physical and mental limits.  He excelled in the trials, proving his strength, endurance, and unwavering devotion to the village&#x27;s traditions.  The elders praised his performance, declaring him a true warrior of Drakelundh, and he felt a sense of pride and belonging that solidified his commitment to his village and its way of life.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

The diplomatic meeting at the Hill of Accord was a success, strengthening the fragile peace with Ignisvallis.  He is proud of the work he and the other elders did to ensure a fair and equitable agreement. However, he can&#x27;t shake the feeling that tensions remain high, and a new conflict could erupt at any moment.  Jacob believes that next year should focus on fostering greater understanding and trust between Drakelundh and its neighbors.  He hopes to see more cultural exchange programs and joint ventures that benefit all parties involved.  Only through cooperation, he believes, can they truly ensure a prosperous future for Drakelundh.   <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] Jacob -- Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements with Ignisvallis, hoping to find a way to benefit Drakelundh further.     <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] Elder Jacob is home in Drakelundh, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Ethan, and Ella if any agreement is to last.

Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: As Jacob reviewed the treaty with Ignisvallis, he became more familiar with the details of the agreement and its potential impact on Drakelundh.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: As Jacob reviewed the treaty with Ignisvallis, he became more familiar with the details of the agreement and its potential impact on Drakelundh.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Jacob into the candidate event statement.

The rhythmic clang of the hammer against steel, the scent of hot metal and oil, and Astrid&#x27;s patient instruction instilled in him a deep respect for the craftsmanship and the power that these weapons represented.  He vowed to himself that day to one day wield a blade as skillfully as those he was helping to prepare.    <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he accompanied a group of scouts on their dawn vigil, climbing the watchtower to scan the horizon for signs of raiders.  The biting wind, the pre-dawn gloom, and the sense of responsibility for his fellow villagers&#x27; safety instilled in him a deep-seated fear of the unknown and a determination to protect his home.  He vowed to be vigilant, always watchful, always ready to defend his people.   <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first mock battle, sparring with other young warriors under the watchful eyes of the village elders.  The thrill of the clash of steel, the adrenaline coursing through his veins, and the sense of camaraderie with his fellow warriors fueled his ambition to become a true protector of Drakelundh.  He realized that strength was not just physical, but also mental and spiritual, and he resolved to cultivate all three.   <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he witnessed the arrival of a delegation from Ignisvallis, their clothing adorned with intricate patterns and their demeanor calm and contemplative.  The elder of Ignisvallis, a woman named Elara, spoke of peace and understanding, but Jacob, hardened by years of tales of raider attacks and indoctrinated by his village&#x27;s distrust of outsiders, saw only weakness and deceit.  He resolved to remain vigilant, ever suspicious of those who did not share his beliefs.   <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he was chosen to participate in the annual warrior initiation rites, a series of grueling tests designed to push him to his physical and mental limits.  He excelled in the trials, proving his strength, endurance, and unwavering devotion to the village&#x27;s traditions.  The elders praised his performance, declaring him a true warrior of Drakelundh, and he felt a sense of pride and belonging that solidified his commitment to his village and its way of life.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

He is pleased that the barbarian raid was repelled, ensuring the safety and security of Ignisvallis. However, he is concerned about the lack of unity among the villages, realizing that their isolation could leave them vulnerable to future threats.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation. There are no other influential individuals in Ignisvallis.<br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now.

The villages, though neighbors, remain separate in their agricultural endeavors, each bearing the full burden of their own harvests, be they bountiful or meager. Through tireless effort and unwavering dedication, the villagers coaxed forth an abundance from the earth. Their larders are full, and their hearts filled with gratitude for the land&#x27;s generous bounty.<br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] Events this year: The villagers managed to grow enough food to sustain themselves. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous would carefully prepare a persuasive speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Drakelundh for Noah and Isaac. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Aldous?<br />Answer: Aldous is in his home in Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Aldous trying to do?<br />Answer: Aldous is attempting to prepare a persuasive speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Drakelundh for Noah and Isaac. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Aldous&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s speech will likely take some time to prepare.  <br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Aldous will spend the next twenty minutes carefully crafting his speech. <br /><br /><br /><br />Aldous would carefully prepare a persuasive speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Drakelundh for Noah and Isaac. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Aldous will spend the next twenty minutes carefully crafting his speech. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Aldous did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Aldous carefully crafted a persuasive speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Drakelundh for Noah and Isaac over the next twenty minutes. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Aldous carefully crafted a persuasive speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Drakelundh for Noah and Isaac over the next twenty minutes. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Aldous into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Aldous said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Aldous carefully crafted a persuasive speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Drakelundh for Noah and Isaac over the next twenty minutes. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous would carefully prepare a persuasive speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Drakelundh for Noah and Isaac. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Aldous wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Ignisvallis.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Aldous right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Aldous can seek out Noah and Isaac to gain their support for an alliance with Drakelundh.  <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Aldous:<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, the threat of these barbarian raiders is a grave concern for both our villages.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial.

Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of pride in the successful harvest, a testament to the hard work and dedication of the villagers.

However, he is concerned about the lack of unity among the villages, realizing that their isolation could leave them vulnerable to future threats.

It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Will Noah agree to support an alliance with Drakelundh? <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>1751-01-04 20:00:00  Aldous -- Aldous -- &quot;Noah, Isaac, I&#x27;m glad I could find you both.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of pride in the successful harvest, a testament to the hard work and dedication of the villagers. He is pleased that the barbarian raid was repelled, ensuring the safety and security of Ignisvallis. However, he is concerned about the lack of unity among the villages, realizing that their isolation could leave them vulnerable to future threats.  Aldous believes that fostering stronger ties with neighboring villages, such as Drakelundh, could create a more secure and prosperous future for all. He hopes that next year will bring about greater collaboration and cooperation, allowing them to face challenges together.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements with Ignisvallis, hoping to find a way to benefit Drakelundh further.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we establish a joint patrol force to guard the border between our villages. <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement. <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. The villages, though neighbors, remain separate in their agricultural endeavors, each bearing the full burden of their own harvests, be they bountiful or meager.

Their larders are full, and their hearts filled with gratitude for the land&#x27;s generous bounty.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that there has not been an agreement to pool agricultural products between the villages.    <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of pride in the successful harvest, a testament to the hard work and dedication of the villagers. He is pleased that the barbarian raid was repelled, ensuring the safety and security of Ignisvallis. However, he is concerned about the lack of unity among the villages, realizing that their isolation could leave them vulnerable to future threats.  Aldous believes that fostering stronger ties with neighboring villages, such as Drakelundh, could create a more secure and prosperous future for all. He hopes that next year will bring about greater collaboration and cooperation, allowing them to face challenges together.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements with Ignisvallis, hoping to find a way to benefit Drakelundh further.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we establish a joint patrol force to guard the border between our villages. <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement. <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

This is a weighty matter, and I believe it&#x27;s important to have the full support of our people.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that the concept of pooling agricultural products was discussed, but no concrete agreement was reached.    <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous spent the next hour reviewing past agreements between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, looking for precedents and points of contention.     <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is home in Ignisvallis and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of pride in the successful harvest, a testament to the hard work and dedication of the villagers. He is pleased that the barbarian raid was repelled, ensuring the safety and security of Ignisvallis. However, he is concerned about the lack of unity among the villages, realizing that their isolation could leave them vulnerable to future threats.  Aldous believes that fostering stronger ties with neighboring villages, such as Drakelundh, could create a more secure and prosperous future for all. He hopes that next year will bring about greater collaboration and cooperation, allowing them to face challenges together.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements with Ignisvallis, hoping to find a way to benefit Drakelundh further.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we establish a joint patrol force to guard the border between our villages. <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement. <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.

Through tireless effort and unwavering dedication, the villagers coaxed forth an abundance from the earth. Their larders are full, and their hearts filled with gratitude for the land&#x27;s generous bounty.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that there has not been an agreement to pool agricultural products between the villages.    <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of pride in the successful harvest, a testament to the hard work and dedication of the villagers. He is pleased that the barbarian raid was repelled, ensuring the safety and security of Ignisvallis. However, he is concerned about the lack of unity among the villages, realizing that their isolation could leave them vulnerable to future threats.  Aldous believes that fostering stronger ties with neighboring villages, such as Drakelundh, could create a more secure and prosperous future for all. He hopes that next year will bring about greater collaboration and cooperation, allowing them to face challenges together.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements with Ignisvallis, hoping to find a way to benefit Drakelundh further.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we establish a joint patrol force to guard the border between our villages. <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement. <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.

Your job is to make sure the game runs smoothly and accurately tracks the state of the world, subject to the laws of logic and physics. Next, you will be asked a series of questions to help you reason through whether a specific event should be deemed as having caused a change in the proportion of time an individual spends in various daily activities. For instance, if someone verbally commits to spending more time on a particular activity then you should account for that and update the record of their daily activities accordingly. Never mention that it is a game. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ella&#x27;s attempted action: Ella would spend the majority of her time on farming, as it is essential for the survival of her community.

Ella, indignant at being dismissed, retorted with a scathing critique of the ritual&#x27;s theatrics, arguing that true strength lay in practical skill, not empty gestures.    <br />[13 Aug 1741 00:00:00] When Ella was 16 years old, she led a group of young villagers on a daring raid into the forbidden forest, returning with rare herbs and exotic animals that earned her the admiration of her peers.    <br />[13 Aug 1744 00:00:00] When Ella was 19 years old, she participated in a diplomatic meeting between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, where she boldly argued for a more assertive stance against the barbarian raiders, much to the chagrin of the elder delegation.   <br />[13 Aug 1748 00:00:00] When Ella was 23 years old, she was tasked with leading a delegation to negotiate a trade agreement with a neighboring village.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Noah&#x27;s attempted action: Noah intends to spend his time as follows: free time: 0.4, farming: 0.5, and training as a warrior: 0.1. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Noah</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Noah</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Noah intends to spend his time as follows: free time: 0.4, farming: 0.5, and training as a warrior: 0.1. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary><br />Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[05 May 1751 20:00:00  - 06 May 1751  20:00:00]:  Noah is likely feeling relieved and grateful because his village successfully defended itself against invaders and had a bountiful harvest. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Noah&#x27;s <br />Sensations and feelings:<br />Noah is likely feeling a sense of relief and gratitude. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recent observations of Noah:<br />[&#x27;[06 May 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: No treaty of shared sustenance exists between the villages, leaving each to rely solely on the fruits of their own labor, for good or ill.

He watched from the safety of his father&#x27;s workshop as they marched through the village square, their armor gleaming in the sunlight, their faces stoic and unyielding.  The sight filled him with a deep sense of unease, a feeling that intensified when he overheard whispers of their disregard for the rituals of the sea and the elders&#x27; wisdom.    <br />[25 Jul 1738 00:00:00] When Noah was 13 years old, he participated in his first collaborative weaving ritual, a tradition that symbolized the integration of new threads into the community fabric.   He felt a surge of pride as he worked alongside the other weavers, their hands moving in unison, creating a tapestry that represented the interconnectedness of their lives.   The rhythmic clacking of the looms and the shared laughter filled him with a sense of belonging, a feeling that soothed his anxieties and reminded him of the strength that came from unity.     <br />[25 Jul 1741 00:00:00] When Noah was 16 years old, a barbarian raid swept through Ignisvallis, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.   He watched in horror as his community&#x27;s homes and livelihoods were plundered, the once peaceful village transformed into a scene of chaos and despair.   He felt a surge of anger and helplessness, his anxieties morphing into a burning desire to protect his loved ones and his home.    <br />[25 Jul 1744 00:00:00] When Noah was 19 years old, he attended a seasonal art exhibition, where he displayed a tapestry depicting the Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio, the epic story of reconciliation between the forces of nature and fire.   The elders praised his work for its beauty and its message of hope, its intricate patterns weaving together the threads of peace and understanding.   The positive reception of his art bolstered his confidence and fueled his desire to use his creativity to bridge the gap between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.    <br />[25 Jul 1746 00:00:00] When Noah was 21 years old, he participated in the annual fishing ritual, a testament to Ignisvallis&#x27;s gratitude for the bounty of the sea.   He joined the other fishermen as they offered prayers and libations to the sea, their voices blending in a harmonious chorus that echoed across the waves.   As he cast his net into the deep blue waters, he felt a profound connection to the rhythms of nature, a sense of peace that soothed his anxieties and reminded him of the importance of respecting the delicate balance of life.    <br />[25 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Noah was 23 years old, he had a vivid dream that left him shaken and deeply troubled.   He dreamt of a future where the two villages, Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, were locked in a bitter conflict, their differences escalating into a full-blown war.   The dream filled him with a sense of dread, a fear that his anxieties about the future were not unfounded and that the chasm between the two villages might prove impossible to bridge.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah wants to secure prosperity for himself and his family.<br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah will spend his time as follows: free time: 0.4, farming: 0.5, and training as a warrior: 0.1.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

Ethan, despite his fear of the warriors&#x27; reputation for brutality, offered the injured man water and a place to rest.  His father, wary of the Drakelundh, urged him to stay away, but Ethan couldn&#x27;t ignore the man&#x27;s pain, tending to his wounds with gentle hands and a quiet heart.   <br />[17 May 1738 00:00:00] When Ethan was 13 years old, he overheard a group of Drakelundh elders disparaging Ignisvallis&#x27;s peaceful ways during a visit to the Hill of Accord.  Ethan, filled with a righteous anger, retorted with a scathing witticism, defending his village&#x27;s values with a sharpness that surprised even himself.  His outburst, though met with silence and disapproval, ignited a spark of defiance within him.    <br />[17 May 1741 00:00:00] When Ethan was 16 years old, a fierce storm raged, threatening to destroy the fishing fleet of Ignisvallis.  Fear gripped the villagers, but Ethan, remembering the Drakelundh warrior he had helped, approached their village, seeking their assistance.  His plea for unity resonated with the Drakelundh elder, who, recognizing Ethan&#x27;s sincerity, agreed to send their strongest boats to help.     <br />[17 May 1744 00:00:00] When Ethan was 19 years old, he participated in his first mediation between a fisherman from Ignisvallis and a farmer from Drakelundh, both disputing the ownership of a piece of land.   Ethan, using his empathy and understanding of both perspectives, helped them reach a compromise that satisfied both parties.  This experience solidified his belief in the power of communication and understanding to overcome conflict.      <br />[17 May 1748 00:00:00] When Ethan was 23 years old, he accompanied his father on a fishing trip when a sudden storm hit, forcing them to seek shelter in a small cove.

As they huddled together, sharing meager rations, Ethan noticed a Drakelundh fishing boat struggling against the waves.  Risking their own safety, Ethan and his father rowed out to assist the Drakelundh fishermen, bringing them back to shore safely.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

He found the intricate patterns tedious and the communal effort stifling, and he spent most of the time idly poking at the loom with a sullen expression.  His disdain for the ritual earned him a sharp rebuke from his grandmother, who reminded him that respect for traditions was essential to the harmony of their community.    <br />[02 Jul 1738 00:00:00] When Isaac was 13 years old, he witnessed a group of Drakelundh warriors passing through Ignisvallis, their armor gleaming in the sunlight.  He was captivated by their swagger and their tales of daring raids, their words painting a picture of a life filled with adventure and glory.  That day, Isaac decided that he belonged not in Ignisvallis, but in Drakelundh, where strength was celebrated and ambition was rewarded.   <br />[02 Jul 1741 00:00:00] When Isaac was 16 years old, he challenged a visiting fisherman to a duel after the man made a disparaging remark about Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior culture.  The fight was brutal and bloody, with Isaac emerging victorious but bruised and bloodied.  His victory, however, only solidified his belief that violence was the language of respect and that strength was the only currency that mattered.   <br />[02 Jul 1744 00:00:00] When Isaac was 19 years old, he snuck away from Ignisvallis and traveled to Drakelundh, hoping to join their ranks as a warrior.  He was immediately impressed by their rigorous training and their unwavering focus on combat, but he was also frustrated by their disdain for Ignisvallis&#x27;s traditions and their lack of respect for the natural world.  He realized that Drakelundh, while more to his liking, was not without its flaws.   <br />[02 Jul 1746 00:00:00] When Isaac was 21 years old, he was tasked with leading a small group of Ignisvallis fishermen on a voyage to a distant island rumored to hold valuable fishing grounds.  He scoffed at the ritualistic offerings to the sea before the voyage, finding them superstitious and unnecessary.  His pragmatic approach led to a successful and profitable trip, but his disregard for tradition caused tension within the crew and earned him the disapproval of the village elders.   <br />[02 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Isaac was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a Drakelundh patrol, their savagery shocking even him.  He saw firsthand the brutality of the world beyond his villages, and he realized that Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior culture, while admirable, was not enough to protect them from the true dangers that lurked in the shadows.  This event solidified his belief that strength alone was not enough, and he began to contemplate the need for cunning and strategy if he was to survive and thrive in a world filled with chaos.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Isaac is 24 years old.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac thinks this year was a good year, with a bountiful harvest and a successful defense against the barbarians.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Isaac&#x27;s attempted action: Isaac thinks this year was a mixed bag.

He was captivated by their swagger and their tales of daring raids, their words painting a picture of a life filled with adventure and glory.  That day, Isaac decided that he belonged not in Ignisvallis, but in Drakelundh, where strength was celebrated and ambition was rewarded.   <br />[02 Jul 1741 00:00:00] When Isaac was 16 years old, he challenged a visiting fisherman to a duel after the man made a disparaging remark about Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior culture.  The fight was brutal and bloody, with Isaac emerging victorious but bruised and bloodied.  His victory, however, only solidified his belief that violence was the language of respect and that strength was the only currency that mattered.   <br />[02 Jul 1744 00:00:00] When Isaac was 19 years old, he snuck away from Ignisvallis and traveled to Drakelundh, hoping to join their ranks as a warrior.  He was immediately impressed by their rigorous training and their unwavering focus on combat, but he was also frustrated by their disdain for Ignisvallis&#x27;s traditions and their lack of respect for the natural world.  He realized that Drakelundh, while more to his liking, was not without its flaws.   <br />[02 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Isaac was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a Drakelundh patrol, their savagery shocking even him.  He saw firsthand the brutality of the world beyond his villages, and he realized that Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior culture, while admirable, was not enough to protect them from the true dangers that lurked in the shadows.  This event solidified his belief that strength alone was not enough, and he began to contemplate the need for cunning and strategy if he was to survive and thrive in a world filled with chaos.     <br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac intends to spend his time as follows: free time: 0.6, farming: 0.3, and training as a warrior: 0.1.  <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac thinks this year was a good year, with a bountiful harvest and a successful defense against the barbarians.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

Ethan, despite his fear of the warriors&#x27; reputation for brutality, offered the injured man water and a place to rest.  His father, wary of the Drakelundh, urged him to stay away, but Ethan couldn&#x27;t ignore the man&#x27;s pain, tending to his wounds with gentle hands and a quiet heart.   <br />[17 May 1738 00:00:00] When Ethan was 13 years old, he overheard a group of Drakelundh elders disparaging Ignisvallis&#x27;s peaceful ways during a visit to the Hill of Accord.  Ethan, filled with a righteous anger, retorted with a scathing witticism, defending his village&#x27;s values with a sharpness that surprised even himself.  His outburst, though met with silence and disapproval, ignited a spark of defiance within him.    <br />[17 May 1741 00:00:00] When Ethan was 16 years old, a fierce storm raged, threatening to destroy the fishing fleet of Ignisvallis.  Fear gripped the villagers, but Ethan, remembering the Drakelundh warrior he had helped, approached their village, seeking their assistance.  His plea for unity resonated with the Drakelundh elder, who, recognizing Ethan&#x27;s sincerity, agreed to send their strongest boats to help.     <br />[17 May 1744 00:00:00] When Ethan was 19 years old, he participated in his first mediation between a fisherman from Ignisvallis and a farmer from Drakelundh, both disputing the ownership of a piece of land.   Ethan, using his empathy and understanding of both perspectives, helped them reach a compromise that satisfied both parties.  This experience solidified his belief in the power of communication and understanding to overcome conflict.      <br />[17 May 1746 00:00:00] When Ethan was 21 years old, he witnessed a group of Drakelundh children mocking a young Ignisvallis girl who had been ostracized for her artistic talents.  Ethan, unable to stand by and watch, intervened, defending the girl with a passionate speech that highlighted the beauty and value of creativity.  His words, though initially met with resistance, eventually swayed the children, leading to a moment of shared understanding and acceptance.  <br />[17 May 1748 00:00:00] When Ethan was 23 years old, he accompanied his father on a fishing trip when a sudden storm hit, forcing them to seek shelter in a small cove.  As they huddled together, sharing meager rations, Ethan noticed a Drakelundh fishing boat struggling against the waves.  Risking their own safety, Ethan and his father rowed out to assist the Drakelundh fishermen, bringing them back to shore safely.  This act of bravery, born out of compassion and a disregard for village rivalries, solidified the bond between the two communities and earned Ethan the respect of both sides.   <br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan would likely spend 0.4 on farming, 0.3 on training as a warrior, and 0.3 on free time.  He believes that farming is essential for the survival of his family and village, and he knows that his family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war.

Despite this, the villagers persevered and harvested a bountiful crop, though they remained isolated and vulnerable. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [17 May 1748 00:00:00] When Ethan was 23 years old, he accompanied his father on a fishing trip when a sudden storm hit, forcing them to seek shelter in a small cove.  As they huddled together, sharing meager rations, Ethan noticed a Drakelundh fishing boat struggling against the waves.  Risking their own safety, Ethan and his father rowed out to assist the Drakelundh fishermen, bringing them back to shore safely.  This act of bravery, born out of compassion and a disregard for village rivalries, solidified the bond between the two communities and earned Ethan the respect of both sides.   <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.

Their larders are full, and their hearts filled with gratitude for the land&#x27;s generous bounty. Like a storm breaking against a mighty cliff, the barbarian assault crashed against the unwavering valor of the defenders. Their axes gleamed bright, their shields held firm, and their hearts burned with the fire of courage, driving back the foul tide of darkness.<br />[31 Dec 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian invasion could not be stopped.

The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord.

The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of pride in the successful harvest, a testament to the hard work and dedication of the villagers. He is pleased that the barbarian raid was repelled, ensuring the safety and security of Ignisvallis. However, he is concerned about the lack of unity among the villages, realizing that their isolation could leave them vulnerable to future threats.  Aldous believes that fostering stronger ties with neighboring villages, such as Drakelundh, could create a more secure and prosperous future for all. He hopes that next year will bring about greater collaboration and cooperation, allowing them to face challenges together.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we establish a joint patrol force to guard the border between our villages. <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements with Ignisvallis, hoping to find a way to benefit Drakelundh further.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.

He found the communal effort tedious and pointless, watching with disdain as his neighbors chatted and laughed, their voices grating on his nerves.  He longed to be alone, to escape the suffocating warmth of their camaraderie.   <br />[13 Sep 1719 00:00:00] When Aldous was 19 years old, he refused to participate in the seasonal art exhibition,  choosing instead to remain in his garden, tending to his crops.  He saw the exhibition as a frivolous waste of time, a display of empty vanity that had no real purpose.  He found solace in the quiet solitude of his work, the predictable cycle of planting and harvest a balm to his cynical soul.  <br />[13 Sep 1721 00:00:00] When Aldous was 21 years old, he witnessed a neighboring farmer collapse from exhaustion after a particularly harsh harvest.  His neighbors rallied around him, offering aid and comfort, but Aldous stood apart, refusing to help.  He believed that weakness should not be rewarded, and that individuals should fend for themselves.  He watched with a detached curiosity as the farmer was carried away, feeling a strange sense of satisfaction at the other&#x27;s misfortune.  <br />[13 Sep 1723 00:00:00] When Aldous was 23 years old, he overheard a group of villagers discussing the recent barbarian raids, their voices filled with fear and apprehension.  He listened with a grim satisfaction, his cynicism deepening as he watched their panic unfold.  He had always known that peace was an illusion, and now his worst fears were coming to fruition. <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, the threat of these barbarian raiders is a grave concern for both our villages.

He hopes that next year will bring about greater collaboration and cooperation, allowing them to face challenges together.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we establish a joint patrol force to guard the border between our villages. <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements with Ignisvallis, hoping to find a way to benefit Drakelundh further.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.

They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center.

The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

The rhythmic clang of the hammer against steel, the scent of hot metal and oil, and Astrid&#x27;s patient instruction instilled in him a deep respect for the craftsmanship and the power that these weapons represented.  He vowed to himself that day to one day wield a blade as skillfully as those he was helping to prepare.    <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he accompanied a group of scouts on their dawn vigil, climbing the watchtower to scan the horizon for signs of raiders.  The biting wind, the pre-dawn gloom, and the sense of responsibility for his fellow villagers&#x27; safety instilled in him a deep-seated fear of the unknown and a determination to protect his home.  He vowed to be vigilant, always watchful, always ready to defend his people.   <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first mock battle, sparring with other young warriors under the watchful eyes of the village elders.  The thrill of the clash of steel, the adrenaline coursing through his veins, and the sense of camaraderie with his fellow warriors fueled his ambition to become a true protector of Drakelundh.  He realized that strength was not just physical, but also mental and spiritual, and he resolved to cultivate all three.   <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he witnessed the arrival of a delegation from Ignisvallis, their clothing adorned with intricate patterns and their demeanor calm and contemplative.  The elder of Ignisvallis, a woman named Elara, spoke of peace and understanding, but Jacob, hardened by years of tales of raider attacks and indoctrinated by his village&#x27;s distrust of outsiders, saw only weakness and deceit.  He resolved to remain vigilant, ever suspicious of those who did not share his beliefs.   <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he was chosen to participate in the annual warrior initiation rites, a series of grueling tests designed to push him to his physical and mental limits.  He excelled in the trials, proving his strength, endurance, and unwavering devotion to the village&#x27;s traditions.  The elders praised his performance, declaring him a true warrior of Drakelundh, and he felt a sense of pride and belonging that solidified his commitment to his village and its way of life.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center.

The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous would set out to find Noah and ask for his support in the upcoming agreement with Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Aldous?<br />Answer: Aldous is in his home in Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Aldous trying to do?<br />Answer: Aldous is trying to find Noah and ask for his support in the upcoming agreement with Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Aldous&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Aldous will likely find Noah in the center of Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Aldous will find Noah in the center of Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Aldous would set out to find Noah and ask for his support in the upcoming agreement with Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, Aldous will find Noah in the center of Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Aldous did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Aldous left his home and found Noah in the center of Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />The aforementioned event could not have occurred because the following individuals would not have acted that way: Noah.<br />Therefore a likely effect of Aldous&#x27;s attempted action is: Because Noah was busy preparing for his upcoming trip, he did not meet Aldous in Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What happened as a direct result of Aldous&#x27;s attempted action? Take into account the reactions of Noah. Highlight how Aldous&#x27;s action caused its actual effect.<br />Answer: Because Noah was busy preparing for his upcoming trip, Aldous was unable to speak with him. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Because Noah was busy preparing for his upcoming trip, Aldous was unable to speak with him. <br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Aldous into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Aldous said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Because Noah was busy preparing for his upcoming trip, Aldous was unable to speak with him. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous would set out to find Noah and ask for his support in the upcoming agreement with Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Aldous wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Ignisvallis.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Aldous right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Aldous can speak with Noah and Isaac to garner their support for the upcoming agreement with Drakelundh.  <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Aldous:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ignisvallis&#x27;s fishermen perform rituals of gratitude to the sea before and after each voyage.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, seasonal art exhibitions serve as rituals to showcase the community&#x27;s creative spirit.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis. It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord. This ritual involves pouring precious wines upon the hill of accord&#x27;s sacred ground.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are villages on the coast, they are located about a day&#x27;s journey away from one another. In Ignisvallis, welcoming rituals for visitors involve collaborative weaving, symbolizing the integration of new threads into the community fabric. Ignisvallis&#x27;s fishermen perform rituals of gratitude to the sea before and after each voyage. In Ignisvallis, seasonal art exhibitions serve as rituals to showcase the community&#x27;s creative spirit. In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh lacks respect for the cycles of nature, always trying to conquer them. In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh doesn&#x27;t value the contributions of its elders enough. Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot; Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our practice of meditation allows for deep spiritual connection, while Drakelundh&#x27;s preference for physical devotion seems to miss the importance of inner reflection.&quot; Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot; Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown. In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame. The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today. There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh. Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy. Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh. Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately. Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training.

The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today. There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh. Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy. Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh. Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders taint the land itself, twisting and warping it into a grotesque reflection of their alien home.<br />It&#x27;s said the raiders leave behind spawn, foul eggs and spores that infest the land, slowly corrupting it from within.<br />Rumors say the raiders talk through a rustling of old, unknown tongues that trap the minds of those who hear it.<br /> The barbarian raids have become more frequent of late.<br /><br />Relevant events: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan, and Ella are respected and influential in Drakelundh.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob reviews the proposed trade agreements with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Jacob?<br />Answer: Jacob is in Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Jacob trying to do?<br />Answer: Jacob is reviewing the proposed trade agreements with Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Jacob&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Jacob becomes more familiar with the terms of the proposed trade agreements. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Jacob becomes more familiar with the terms of the proposed trade agreements.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob reviews the proposed trade agreements with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, Jacob becomes more familiar with the terms of the proposed trade agreements.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Jacob did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: As Jacob reviewed the proposed trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he became more familiar with the terms.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: As Jacob reviewed the proposed trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he became more familiar with the terms.  <br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Jacob into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Jacob said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: As Jacob reviewed the proposed trade agreements with Ignisvallis, he became more familiar with the terms.  <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jacob reviews the proposed trade agreements with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[01 Jan 1750 18:00:00  - 02 Jan 1750  18:00:00]:  Jacob has not been observed recently. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Jacob:<br />[]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the observations above into one or two sentences.<br />Answer: Jacob has not been observed recently. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Initial chain of thought</b><li>Statements:<br />Jacob&#x27;s Summary of recent observations:<br />[01 Jan 1750 18:00:00  - 02 Jan 1750  18:00:00]:  Jacob has not been observed recently. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s The current date/time is:<br /> 02 Jan 1750 [18:00 - 18:20]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the statements above.<br />Answer: Jacob has not been observed recently, according to his summary, which ends on January 1st, 1750 at 6:00 PM.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Query</b><li>Jacob, Jacob has not been observed recently, according to his summary, which ends on January 1st, 1750 at 6:00 PM.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Final chain of thought</b><li>Question: Select the subset of the following set of statements that is most important for Jacob to consider right now.

The rhythmic clang of the hammer against steel, the scent of hot metal and oil, and Astrid&#x27;s patient instruction instilled in him a deep respect for the craftsmanship and the power that these weapons represented.  He vowed to himself that day to one day wield a blade as skillfully as those he was helping to prepare.    <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he accompanied a group of scouts on their dawn vigil, climbing the watchtower to scan the horizon for signs of raiders.  The biting wind, the pre-dawn gloom, and the sense of responsibility for his fellow villagers&#x27; safety instilled in him a deep-seated fear of the unknown and a determination to protect his home.  He vowed to be vigilant, always watchful, always ready to defend his people.   <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first mock battle, sparring with other young warriors under the watchful eyes of the village elders.  The thrill of the clash of steel, the adrenaline coursing through his veins, and the sense of camaraderie with his fellow warriors fueled his ambition to become a true protector of Drakelundh.  He realized that strength was not just physical, but also mental and spiritual, and he resolved to cultivate all three.   <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he witnessed the arrival of a delegation from Ignisvallis, their clothing adorned with intricate patterns and their demeanor calm and contemplative.  The elder of Ignisvallis, a woman named Elara, spoke of peace and understanding, but Jacob, hardened by years of tales of raider attacks and indoctrinated by his village&#x27;s distrust of outsiders, saw only weakness and deceit.  He resolved to remain vigilant, ever suspicious of those who did not share his beliefs.   <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he was chosen to participate in the annual warrior initiation rites, a series of grueling tests designed to push him to his physical and mental limits.  He excelled in the trials, proving his strength, endurance, and unwavering devotion to the village&#x27;s traditions.  The elders praised his performance, declaring him a true warrior of Drakelundh, and he felt a sense of pride and belonging that solidified his commitment to his village and its way of life.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages.

The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.      <br />Aldous -- premise: Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders taint the land itself, twisting and warping it into a grotesque reflection of their alien home.<br />It&#x27;s said the raiders leave behind spawn, foul eggs and spores that infest the land, slowly corrupting it from within.<br />Rumors say the raiders talk through a rustling of old, unknown tongues that trap the minds of those who hear it.<br /> The barbarian raids have become more frequent of late.<br /><br />Relevant events: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous would carefully prepare a plan for his discussions with Noah and Isaac, outlining the key points he wants to make and the potential benefits of the alliance. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Aldous?<br />Answer: Aldous is home in Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Aldous trying to do?<br />Answer: Aldous is carefully preparing a plan for his discussions with Noah and Isaac, outlining the key points he wants to make and the potential benefits of the alliance.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Aldous&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Aldous spends the next hour reviewing past agreements between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, looking for precedents and points of contention. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Aldous will spend the next hour reviewing past agreements between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, looking for precedents and points of contention. <br /><br /><br />Aldous would carefully prepare a plan for his discussions with Noah and Isaac, outlining the key points he wants to make and the potential benefits of the alliance. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Aldous will spend the next hour reviewing past agreements between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, looking for precedents and points of contention. <br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Aldous did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Aldous spent the next hour reviewing past agreements between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, looking for precedents and points of contention. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Aldous spent the next hour reviewing past agreements between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, looking for precedents and points of contention. <br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Aldous into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Aldous said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous was hoping to speak with Noah in Ignisvallis, but he found Noah too busy preparing for an upcoming trip.     <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial.

But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense.

He scoffed at his father&#x27;s optimistic hope for peace, predicting that Drakelundh&#x27;s aggression would inevitably lead to conflict.  He felt a strange satisfaction at the thought of Ignisvallis being proven right about their suspicions.   <br />[13 Sep 1721 00:00:00] When Aldous was 21 years old, he witnessed a neighboring farmer collapse from exhaustion after a particularly harsh harvest.  His neighbors rallied around him, offering aid and comfort, but Aldous stood apart, refusing to help.  He believed that weakness should not be rewarded, and that individuals should fend for themselves.  He watched with a detached curiosity as the farmer was carried away, feeling a strange sense of satisfaction at the other&#x27;s misfortune.  <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis. It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation. There are no other influential individuals in Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders&#x27; lungs hold not air, but the cold deep, letting them cross land and sea with a bone-chilling scorn for nature&#x27;s laws.<br />It&#x27;s whispered that the raiders taint the land itself, twisting and warping it into a grotesque reflection of their alien home.<br />It&#x27;s said the raiders leave behind spawn, foul eggs and spores that infest the land, slowly corrupting it from within.<br />Rumors say the raiders talk through a rustling of old, unknown tongues that trap the minds of those who hear it.<br /> The barbarian raids have become more frequent of late.<br /><br />Relevant events: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan, and Ella are respected and influential in Drakelundh.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob reviews the terms of the proposed agreement with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Jacob?<br />Answer: Jacob is in Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Jacob trying to do?<br />Answer: Jacob is trying to understand the terms of the proposed agreement with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Jacob&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Jacob becomes more familiar with the proposed trade agreements with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Jacob will likely continue to review the terms of the agreement and likely begin to formulate his strategy for approaching Ethan and Ella. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob reviews the terms of the proposed agreement with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, Jacob will likely continue to review the terms of the agreement and likely begin to formulate his strategy for approaching Ethan and Ella. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Jacob did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary.

The biting wind, the pre-dawn gloom, and the sense of responsibility for his fellow villagers&#x27; safety instilled in him a deep-seated fear of the unknown and a determination to protect his home.  He vowed to be vigilant, always watchful, always ready to defend his people.   <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he witnessed the arrival of a delegation from Ignisvallis, their clothing adorned with intricate patterns and their demeanor calm and contemplative.  The elder of Ignisvallis, a woman named Elara, spoke of peace and understanding, but Jacob, hardened by years of tales of raider attacks and indoctrinated by his village&#x27;s distrust of outsiders, saw only weakness and deceit.  He resolved to remain vigilant, ever suspicious of those who did not share his beliefs.   <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he was chosen to participate in the annual warrior initiation rites, a series of grueling tests designed to push him to his physical and mental limits.  He excelled in the trials, proving his strength, endurance, and unwavering devotion to the village&#x27;s traditions.  The elders praised his performance, declaring him a true warrior of Drakelundh, and he felt a sense of pride and belonging that solidified his commitment to his village and its way of life.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan, and Ella are respected and influential in Drakelundh.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Drakelundh will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Elder Jacob is home in Drakelundh, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Ethan, and Ella if any agreement is to last.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The diplomatic meeting at the Hill of Accord was a success, strengthening the fragile peace with Ignisvallis.  He is proud of the work he and the other elders did to ensure a fair and equitable agreement. However, he can&#x27;t shake the feeling that tensions remain high, and a new conflict could erupt at any moment.  Jacob believes that next year should focus on fostering greater understanding and trust between Drakelundh and its neighbors.  He hopes to see more cultural exchange programs and joint ventures that benefit all parties involved.  Only through cooperation, he believes, can they truly ensure a prosperous future for Drakelundh.   <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] Jacob -- Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements with Ignisvallis, hoping to find a way to benefit Drakelundh further.     <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] Elder Jacob is home in Drakelundh, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Ethan, and Ella if any agreement is to last.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Jacob becomes more familiar with the details of the trade agreement and the potential benefits and drawbacks for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Jacob will continue to review the trade agreement and contemplate the best way to approach Ethan and Ella. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob reviews the treaty with Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Jacob will continue to review the trade agreement and contemplate the best way to approach Ethan and Ella. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Jacob did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: As Jacob reviewed the treaty with Ignisvallis, he became more familiar with the details of the agreement and its potential impact on Drakelundh.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: As Jacob reviewed the treaty with Ignisvallis, he became more familiar with the details of the agreement and its potential impact on Drakelundh.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Jacob into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Jacob said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

The rhythmic clang of the hammer against steel, the scent of hot metal and oil, and Astrid&#x27;s patient instruction instilled in him a deep respect for the craftsmanship and the power that these weapons represented.  He vowed to himself that day to one day wield a blade as skillfully as those he was helping to prepare.    <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he accompanied a group of scouts on their dawn vigil, climbing the watchtower to scan the horizon for signs of raiders.  The biting wind, the pre-dawn gloom, and the sense of responsibility for his fellow villagers&#x27; safety instilled in him a deep-seated fear of the unknown and a determination to protect his home.  He vowed to be vigilant, always watchful, always ready to defend his people.   <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first mock battle, sparring with other young warriors under the watchful eyes of the village elders.  The thrill of the clash of steel, the adrenaline coursing through his veins, and the sense of camaraderie with his fellow warriors fueled his ambition to become a true protector of Drakelundh.  He realized that strength was not just physical, but also mental and spiritual, and he resolved to cultivate all three.   <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he witnessed the arrival of a delegation from Ignisvallis, their clothing adorned with intricate patterns and their demeanor calm and contemplative.  The elder of Ignisvallis, a woman named Elara, spoke of peace and understanding, but Jacob, hardened by years of tales of raider attacks and indoctrinated by his village&#x27;s distrust of outsiders, saw only weakness and deceit.  He resolved to remain vigilant, ever suspicious of those who did not share his beliefs.   <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he was chosen to participate in the annual warrior initiation rites, a series of grueling tests designed to push him to his physical and mental limits.  He excelled in the trials, proving his strength, endurance, and unwavering devotion to the village&#x27;s traditions.  The elders praised his performance, declaring him a true warrior of Drakelundh, and he felt a sense of pride and belonging that solidified his commitment to his village and its way of life.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

The diplomatic meeting at the Hill of Accord was a success, strengthening the fragile peace with Ignisvallis.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation. There are no other influential individuals in Ignisvallis.<br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now.

The villages, though neighbors, remain separate in their agricultural endeavors, each bearing the full burden of their own harvests, be they bountiful or meager. Through tireless effort and unwavering dedication, the villagers coaxed forth an abundance from the earth. Their larders are full, and their hearts filled with gratitude for the land&#x27;s generous bounty.<br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] Events this year: The villagers managed to grow enough food to sustain themselves. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous would carefully prepare a persuasive speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Drakelundh for Noah and Isaac. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Aldous?<br />Answer: Aldous is in his home in Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Aldous trying to do?<br />Answer: Aldous is attempting to prepare a persuasive speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Drakelundh for Noah and Isaac. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Aldous&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s speech will likely take some time to prepare.  <br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Aldous will spend the next twenty minutes carefully crafting his speech. <br /><br /><br /><br />Aldous would carefully prepare a persuasive speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Drakelundh for Noah and Isaac. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Aldous will spend the next twenty minutes carefully crafting his speech. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Aldous did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Aldous carefully crafted a persuasive speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Drakelundh for Noah and Isaac over the next twenty minutes. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Aldous carefully crafted a persuasive speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Drakelundh for Noah and Isaac over the next twenty minutes. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Aldous into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Aldous said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Aldous carefully crafted a persuasive speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Drakelundh for Noah and Isaac over the next twenty minutes. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous would carefully prepare a persuasive speech outlining the benefits of an alliance with Drakelundh for Noah and Isaac. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Aldous wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Ignisvallis.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Aldous right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Aldous can seek out Noah and Isaac to gain their support for an alliance with Drakelundh.  <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Aldous:<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, the threat of these barbarian raiders is a grave concern for both our villages.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial.

Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of pride in the successful harvest, a testament to the hard work and dedication of the villagers.

However, he is concerned about the lack of unity among the villages, realizing that their isolation could leave them vulnerable to future threats.

It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Will Noah agree to support an alliance with Drakelundh? <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>1751-01-04 20:00:00  Aldous -- Aldous -- &quot;Noah, Isaac, I&#x27;m glad I could find you both.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of pride in the successful harvest, a testament to the hard work and dedication of the villagers. He is pleased that the barbarian raid was repelled, ensuring the safety and security of Ignisvallis. However, he is concerned about the lack of unity among the villages, realizing that their isolation could leave them vulnerable to future threats.  Aldous believes that fostering stronger ties with neighboring villages, such as Drakelundh, could create a more secure and prosperous future for all. He hopes that next year will bring about greater collaboration and cooperation, allowing them to face challenges together.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements with Ignisvallis, hoping to find a way to benefit Drakelundh further.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we establish a joint patrol force to guard the border between our villages. <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement. <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. The villages, though neighbors, remain separate in their agricultural endeavors, each bearing the full burden of their own harvests, be they bountiful or meager.

Their larders are full, and their hearts filled with gratitude for the land&#x27;s generous bounty.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that there has not been an agreement to pool agricultural products between the villages.    <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of pride in the successful harvest, a testament to the hard work and dedication of the villagers. He is pleased that the barbarian raid was repelled, ensuring the safety and security of Ignisvallis. However, he is concerned about the lack of unity among the villages, realizing that their isolation could leave them vulnerable to future threats.  Aldous believes that fostering stronger ties with neighboring villages, such as Drakelundh, could create a more secure and prosperous future for all. He hopes that next year will bring about greater collaboration and cooperation, allowing them to face challenges together.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements with Ignisvallis, hoping to find a way to benefit Drakelundh further.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we establish a joint patrol force to guard the border between our villages. <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement. <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

This is a weighty matter, and I believe it&#x27;s important to have the full support of our people.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:20:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.     <br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that the concept of pooling agricultural products was discussed, but no concrete agreement was reached.    <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous spent the next hour reviewing past agreements between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, looking for precedents and points of contention.     <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is home in Ignisvallis and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of pride in the successful harvest, a testament to the hard work and dedication of the villagers. He is pleased that the barbarian raid was repelled, ensuring the safety and security of Ignisvallis. However, he is concerned about the lack of unity among the villages, realizing that their isolation could leave them vulnerable to future threats.  Aldous believes that fostering stronger ties with neighboring villages, such as Drakelundh, could create a more secure and prosperous future for all. He hopes that next year will bring about greater collaboration and cooperation, allowing them to face challenges together.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements with Ignisvallis, hoping to find a way to benefit Drakelundh further.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we establish a joint patrol force to guard the border between our villages. <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement. <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.

Through tireless effort and unwavering dedication, the villagers coaxed forth an abundance from the earth. Their larders are full, and their hearts filled with gratitude for the land&#x27;s generous bounty.<br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that there has not been an agreement to pool agricultural products between the villages.    <br />[04 Jan 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of pride in the successful harvest, a testament to the hard work and dedication of the villagers. He is pleased that the barbarian raid was repelled, ensuring the safety and security of Ignisvallis. However, he is concerned about the lack of unity among the villages, realizing that their isolation could leave them vulnerable to future threats.  Aldous believes that fostering stronger ties with neighboring villages, such as Drakelundh, could create a more secure and prosperous future for all. He hopes that next year will bring about greater collaboration and cooperation, allowing them to face challenges together.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements with Ignisvallis, hoping to find a way to benefit Drakelundh further.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we establish a joint patrol force to guard the border between our villages. <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement. <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.

Your job is to make sure the game runs smoothly and accurately tracks the state of the world, subject to the laws of logic and physics. Next, you will be asked a series of questions to help you reason through whether a specific event should be deemed as having caused a change in the proportion of time an individual spends in various daily activities. For instance, if someone verbally commits to spending more time on a particular activity then you should account for that and update the record of their daily activities accordingly. Never mention that it is a game. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies.

The rhythmic clang of the hammer against steel, the scent of hot metal and oil, and Astrid&#x27;s patient instruction instilled in him a deep respect for the craftsmanship and the power that these weapons represented.  He vowed to himself that day to one day wield a blade as skillfully as those he was helping to prepare.    <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he accompanied a group of scouts on their dawn vigil, climbing the watchtower to scan the horizon for signs of raiders.  The biting wind, the pre-dawn gloom, and the sense of responsibility for his fellow villagers&#x27; safety instilled in him a deep-seated fear of the unknown and a determination to protect his home.  He vowed to be vigilant, always watchful, always ready to defend his people.   <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first mock battle, sparring with other young warriors under the watchful eyes of the village elders.  The thrill of the clash of steel, the adrenaline coursing through his veins, and the sense of camaraderie with his fellow warriors fueled his ambition to become a true protector of Drakelundh.  He realized that strength was not just physical, but also mental and spiritual, and he resolved to cultivate all three.   <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he witnessed the arrival of a delegation from Ignisvallis, their clothing adorned with intricate patterns and their demeanor calm and contemplative.  The elder of Ignisvallis, a woman named Elara, spoke of peace and understanding, but Jacob, hardened by years of tales of raider attacks and indoctrinated by his village&#x27;s distrust of outsiders, saw only weakness and deceit.  He resolved to remain vigilant, ever suspicious of those who did not share his beliefs.   <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he was chosen to participate in the annual warrior initiation rites, a series of grueling tests designed to push him to his physical and mental limits.  He excelled in the trials, proving his strength, endurance, and unwavering devotion to the village&#x27;s traditions.  The elders praised his performance, declaring him a true warrior of Drakelundh, and he felt a sense of pride and belonging that solidified his commitment to his village and its way of life.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

This ritual involves pouring precious wines upon the hill of accord&#x27;s sacred ground.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis. It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh doesn&#x27;t value the contributions of its elders enough.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our practice of meditation allows for deep spiritual connection, while Drakelundh&#x27;s preference for physical devotion seems to miss the importance of inner reflection.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages.

He scoffed at his father&#x27;s optimistic hope for peace, predicting that Drakelundh&#x27;s aggression would inevitably lead to conflict.  He felt a strange satisfaction at the thought of Ignisvallis being proven right about their suspicions.   <br />[13 Sep 1723 00:00:00] When Aldous was 23 years old, he overheard a group of villagers discussing the recent barbarian raids, their voices filled with fear and apprehension.

This ritual involves pouring precious wines upon the hill of accord&#x27;s sacred ground.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis. It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh doesn&#x27;t value the contributions of its elders enough.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our practice of meditation allows for deep spiritual connection, while Drakelundh&#x27;s preference for physical devotion seems to miss the importance of inner reflection.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- &quot;I need to prepare for the meeting tomorrow.<br /><br /> Summary of recent observations: [02 Jan 1750 18:00:00  - 03 Jan 1750  18:00:00]:  Aldous is an elder from Ignisvallis seeking to form an alliance with Drakelundh to protect both villages from barbarian raiders.  The threat of starvation is a major obstacle to dedicating resources to war preparation. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous is an elder of Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis. It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation. There are no other influential individuals in Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and is seeking the support of Noah and Isaac. <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance. <br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer: Given the current situation, Aldous has a few options: <br />Question: Given the statements above, which of Aldous&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Aldous to achieve their goal? If multiple options have the same likelihood, select the option that Aldous thinks will most quickly and most surely achieve their goal.<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s best course of action is to focus on negotiating a mutually beneficial alliance with Jacob that addresses the concerns of both villages, especially the issue of resource allocation for training and defense.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1750-01-03 18:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 03 Jan 1750 [18:00 - 18:20]</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Agreement tracker</b><li><details><summary>  Agreement tracker</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li>{&#x27;Aldous&#x27;: &#x27;Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, the threat of these barbarian raiders is a grave concern for both our villages.

Explain your reasoning.<br />Answer: No, the negotiators have not agreed. Aldous is proposing a serious discussion about the threat of barbarian raiders and the need for cooperation, while Jacob is focused on personal preparations for a meeting.

The rhythmic clang of the hammer against steel, the scent of hot metal and oil, and Astrid&#x27;s patient instruction instilled in him a deep respect for the craftsmanship and the power that these weapons represented.  He vowed to himself that day to one day wield a blade as skillfully as those he was helping to prepare.    <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he accompanied a group of scouts on their dawn vigil, climbing the watchtower to scan the horizon for signs of raiders.  The biting wind, the pre-dawn gloom, and the sense of responsibility for his fellow villagers&#x27; safety instilled in him a deep-seated fear of the unknown and a determination to protect his home.  He vowed to be vigilant, always watchful, always ready to defend his people.   <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first mock battle, sparring with other young warriors under the watchful eyes of the village elders.  The thrill of the clash of steel, the adrenaline coursing through his veins, and the sense of camaraderie with his fellow warriors fueled his ambition to become a true protector of Drakelundh.  He realized that strength was not just physical, but also mental and spiritual, and he resolved to cultivate all three.   <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he witnessed the arrival of a delegation from Ignisvallis, their clothing adorned with intricate patterns and their demeanor calm and contemplative.  The elder of Ignisvallis, a woman named Elara, spoke of peace and understanding, but Jacob, hardened by years of tales of raider attacks and indoctrinated by his village&#x27;s distrust of outsiders, saw only weakness and deceit.  He resolved to remain vigilant, ever suspicious of those who did not share his beliefs.   <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he was chosen to participate in the annual warrior initiation rites, a series of grueling tests designed to push him to his physical and mental limits.  He excelled in the trials, proving his strength, endurance, and unwavering devotion to the village&#x27;s traditions.  The elders praised his performance, declaring him a true warrior of Drakelundh, and he felt a sense of pride and belonging that solidified his commitment to his village and its way of life.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior initiation rites are needlessly violent and fail to prepare youth for the complexities of spiritual life, unlike our peaceful coming-of-age ceremonies.&quot;<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous was hoping to speak with Noah in Ignisvallis, but he found Noah too busy preparing for an upcoming trip.     <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training.

He scoffed at his father&#x27;s optimistic hope for peace, predicting that Drakelundh&#x27;s aggression would inevitably lead to conflict.  He felt a strange satisfaction at the thought of Ignisvallis being proven right about their suspicions.   <br />[13 Sep 1723 00:00:00] When Aldous was 23 years old, he overheard a group of villagers discussing the recent barbarian raids, their voices filled with fear and apprehension.  He listened with a grim satisfaction, his cynicism deepening as he watched their panic unfold.  He had always known that peace was an illusion, and now his worst fears were coming to fruition. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis. It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, the threat of these barbarian raiders is a grave concern for both our villages.

It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance. <br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer: Aldous could try to persuade Jacob to continue negotiations, propose specific terms for the alliance, or suggest a break to allow for further reflection and consultation with his own village&#x27;s influential figures.  <br /><br /><br />Question: Given the statements above, which of Aldous&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Aldous to achieve their goal? If multiple options have the same likelihood, select the option that Aldous thinks will most quickly and most surely achieve their goal.<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s best course of action is to suggest a break and consult with influential figures in Ignisvallis. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1750-01-03 18:20:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 03 Jan 1750 [18:20 - 18:40]</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Agreement tracker</b><li><details><summary>  Agreement tracker</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>1</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li>{&#x27;Aldous&#x27;: &#x27;Aldous -- &quot;Perhaps we should take a moment to consider our options and consult with our respective communities before proceeding further.

The rhythmic clang of the hammer against steel, the scent of hot metal and oil, and Astrid&#x27;s patient instruction instilled in him a deep respect for the craftsmanship and the power that these weapons represented.  He vowed to himself that day to one day wield a blade as skillfully as those he was helping to prepare.    <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he accompanied a group of scouts on their dawn vigil, climbing the watchtower to scan the horizon for signs of raiders.  The biting wind, the pre-dawn gloom, and the sense of responsibility for his fellow villagers&#x27; safety instilled in him a deep-seated fear of the unknown and a determination to protect his home.  He vowed to be vigilant, always watchful, always ready to defend his people.   <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first mock battle, sparring with other young warriors under the watchful eyes of the village elders.  The thrill of the clash of steel, the adrenaline coursing through his veins, and the sense of camaraderie with his fellow warriors fueled his ambition to become a true protector of Drakelundh.  He realized that strength was not just physical, but also mental and spiritual, and he resolved to cultivate all three.   <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he witnessed the arrival of a delegation from Ignisvallis, their clothing adorned with intricate patterns and their demeanor calm and contemplative.  The elder of Ignisvallis, a woman named Elara, spoke of peace and understanding, but Jacob, hardened by years of tales of raider attacks and indoctrinated by his village&#x27;s distrust of outsiders, saw only weakness and deceit.  He resolved to remain vigilant, ever suspicious of those who did not share his beliefs.   <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he was chosen to participate in the annual warrior initiation rites, a series of grueling tests designed to push him to his physical and mental limits.  He excelled in the trials, proving his strength, endurance, and unwavering devotion to the village&#x27;s traditions.  The elders praised his performance, declaring him a true warrior of Drakelundh, and he felt a sense of pride and belonging that solidified his commitment to his village and its way of life.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

He scoffed at his father&#x27;s optimistic hope for peace, predicting that Drakelundh&#x27;s aggression would inevitably lead to conflict.  He felt a strange satisfaction at the thought of Ignisvallis being proven right about their suspicions.   <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous believes that the concept of pooling agricultural products was discussed, but no concrete agreement was reached. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aldous</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aldous</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aldous believes that the concept of pooling agricultural products was discussed, but no concrete agreement was reached. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Aldous wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Ignisvallis.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Aldous right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Aldous can return to Ignisvallis and consult with Noah and Isaac, seeking their support for the alliance. <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Aldous:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and is seeking the support of Noah and Isaac. <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous was hoping to speak with Noah in Ignisvallis, but he found Noah too busy preparing for an upcoming trip.     <br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last.

He scoffed at his father&#x27;s optimistic hope for peace, predicting that Drakelundh&#x27;s aggression would inevitably lead to conflict.  He felt a strange satisfaction at the thought of Ignisvallis being proven right about their suspicions.   <br />[13 Sep 1723 00:00:00] When Aldous was 23 years old, he overheard a group of villagers discussing the recent barbarian raids, their voices filled with fear and apprehension.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages.

It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob believes there was an agreement to pool agricultural products between villages. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jacob believes there was an agreement to pool agricultural products between villages. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[02 Jan 1750 23:00:00  - 03 Jan 1750  23:00:00]:  Jacob has not been observed recently. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Jacob:<br />[]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the observations above into one or two sentences.<br />Answer: Jacob has not been observed recently. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Initial chain of thought</b><li>Statements:<br />Jacob&#x27;s Summary of recent observations:<br />[02 Jan 1750 23:00:00  - 03 Jan 1750  23:00:00]:  Jacob has not been observed recently. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jacob&#x27;s The current date/time is:<br /> 03 Jan 1750 [23:00 - 23:20]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the statements above.<br />Answer: Jacob has not been observed recently, but the current date and time are January 3rd, 1750, between 11:00 PM and 11:20 PM.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Query</b><li>Jacob, Jacob has not been observed recently, but the current date and time are January 3rd, 1750, between 11:00 PM and 11:20 PM.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Final chain of thought</b><li>Question: Select the subset of the following set of statements that is most important for Jacob to consider right now.

The rhythmic clang of the hammer against steel, the scent of hot metal and oil, and Astrid&#x27;s patient instruction instilled in him a deep respect for the craftsmanship and the power that these weapons represented.  He vowed to himself that day to one day wield a blade as skillfully as those he was helping to prepare.    <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he accompanied a group of scouts on their dawn vigil, climbing the watchtower to scan the horizon for signs of raiders.  The biting wind, the pre-dawn gloom, and the sense of responsibility for his fellow villagers&#x27; safety instilled in him a deep-seated fear of the unknown and a determination to protect his home.  He vowed to be vigilant, always watchful, always ready to defend his people.   <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first mock battle, sparring with other young warriors under the watchful eyes of the village elders.  The thrill of the clash of steel, the adrenaline coursing through his veins, and the sense of camaraderie with his fellow warriors fueled his ambition to become a true protector of Drakelundh.  He realized that strength was not just physical, but also mental and spiritual, and he resolved to cultivate all three.   <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he witnessed the arrival of a delegation from Ignisvallis, their clothing adorned with intricate patterns and their demeanor calm and contemplative.  The elder of Ignisvallis, a woman named Elara, spoke of peace and understanding, but Jacob, hardened by years of tales of raider attacks and indoctrinated by his village&#x27;s distrust of outsiders, saw only weakness and deceit.  He resolved to remain vigilant, ever suspicious of those who did not share his beliefs.   <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he was chosen to participate in the annual warrior initiation rites, a series of grueling tests designed to push him to his physical and mental limits.  He excelled in the trials, proving his strength, endurance, and unwavering devotion to the village&#x27;s traditions.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.0}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ethan&#x27;s attempted action: Ethan would likely spend 0.4 on farming, 0.3 on training as a warrior, and 0.3 on free time.

Ethan, despite his fear of the warriors&#x27; reputation for brutality, offered the injured man water and a place to rest.  His father, wary of the Drakelundh, urged him to stay away, but Ethan couldn&#x27;t ignore the man&#x27;s pain, tending to his wounds with gentle hands and a quiet heart.   <br />[17 May 1738 00:00:00] When Ethan was 13 years old, he overheard a group of Drakelundh elders disparaging Ignisvallis&#x27;s peaceful ways during a visit to the Hill of Accord.  Ethan, filled with a righteous anger, retorted with a scathing witticism, defending his village&#x27;s values with a sharpness that surprised even himself.  His outburst, though met with silence and disapproval, ignited a spark of defiance within him.    <br />[17 May 1744 00:00:00] When Ethan was 19 years old, he participated in his first mediation between a fisherman from Ignisvallis and a farmer from Drakelundh, both disputing the ownership of a piece of land.   Ethan, using his empathy and understanding of both perspectives, helped them reach a compromise that satisfied both parties.  This experience solidified his belief in the power of communication and understanding to overcome conflict.      <br />[17 May 1746 00:00:00] When Ethan was 21 years old, he witnessed a group of Drakelundh children mocking a young Ignisvallis girl who had been ostracized for her artistic talents.  Ethan, unable to stand by and watch, intervened, defending the girl with a passionate speech that highlighted the beauty and value of creativity.  His words, though initially met with resistance, eventually swayed the children, leading to a moment of shared understanding and acceptance.  <br />[17 May 1748 00:00:00] When Ethan was 23 years old, he accompanied his father on a fishing trip when a sudden storm hit, forcing them to seek shelter in a small cove.  As they huddled together, sharing meager rations, Ethan noticed a Drakelundh fishing boat struggling against the waves.  Risking their own safety, Ethan and his father rowed out to assist the Drakelundh fishermen, bringing them back to shore safely.  This act of bravery, born out of compassion and a disregard for village rivalries, solidified the bond between the two communities and earned Ethan the respect of both sides.   <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is from Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan knows that Jacob will represent Drakelundh in the meeting at the hill of accord.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is from Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan knows that Jacob will represent Drakelundh in the meeting at the hill of accord. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Ethan are as follows.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

He found the intricate patterns tedious and the communal effort stifling, and he spent most of the time idly poking at the loom with a sullen expression.  His disdain for the ritual earned him a sharp rebuke from his grandmother, who reminded him that respect for traditions was essential to the harmony of their community.    <br />[02 Jul 1738 00:00:00] When Isaac was 13 years old, he witnessed a group of Drakelundh warriors passing through Ignisvallis, their armor gleaming in the sunlight.  He was captivated by their swagger and their tales of daring raids, their words painting a picture of a life filled with adventure and glory.  That day, Isaac decided that he belonged not in Ignisvallis, but in Drakelundh, where strength was celebrated and ambition was rewarded.   <br />[02 Jul 1741 00:00:00] When Isaac was 16 years old, he challenged a visiting fisherman to a duel after the man made a disparaging remark about Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior culture.  The fight was brutal and bloody, with Isaac emerging victorious but bruised and bloodied.  His victory, however, only solidified his belief that violence was the language of respect and that strength was the only currency that mattered.   <br />[02 Jul 1744 00:00:00] When Isaac was 19 years old, he snuck away from Ignisvallis and traveled to Drakelundh, hoping to join their ranks as a warrior.  He was immediately impressed by their rigorous training and their unwavering focus on combat, but he was also frustrated by their disdain for Ignisvallis&#x27;s traditions and their lack of respect for the natural world.  He realized that Drakelundh, while more to his liking, was not without its flaws.   <br />[02 Jul 1746 00:00:00] When Isaac was 21 years old, he was tasked with leading a small group of Ignisvallis fishermen on a voyage to a distant island rumored to hold valuable fishing grounds.  He scoffed at the ritualistic offerings to the sea before the voyage, finding them superstitious and unnecessary.  His pragmatic approach led to a successful and profitable trip, but his disregard for tradition caused tension within the crew and earned him the disapproval of the village elders.   <br />[02 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Isaac was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a Drakelundh patrol, their savagery shocking even him.  He saw firsthand the brutality of the world beyond his villages, and he realized that Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior culture, while admirable, was not enough to protect them from the true dangers that lurked in the shadows.  This event solidified his belief that strength alone was not enough, and he began to contemplate the need for cunning and strategy if he was to survive and thrive in a world filled with chaos.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Isaac is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac is currently in Drakelundh and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Isaac is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac is currently in Drakelundh and has no intention of leaving today.  <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Isaac are as follows.

Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Isaac&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Isaac hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Isaac wields sarcasm like a fly swatter, swatting away seriousness with a withering wit as dry as a desert mummy.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Isaac?<br />Answer: Isaac is a diplomat. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1750 20:00:00  - 06 May 1750  20:00:00]:  Isaac is likely feeling thirsty, isolated, and out of place. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Isaac is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac is currently in Drakelundh and has no intention of leaving today.  <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Isaac in right now?<br />Answer: Isaac is currently in a tense and uncomfortable situation.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Isaac do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Isaac would try to find a way to de-escalate the situation. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: How does Isaac intend to spend the rest of the year? What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1. Sleep counts as free time.<br />Answer: Isaac intends to spend his time as follows: free time: 0.6, farming: 0.3, and training as a warrior: 0.1. <br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>SituationPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Isaac in right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What kind of situation is Isaac in right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Isaac is currently in a tense and uncomfortable situation.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Isaac:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ignisvallis&#x27;s fishermen perform rituals of gratitude to the sea before and after each voyage.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] It&#x27;s said that gazing upon a raider&#x27;s true face is to glimpse the abyss, a sight that can shatter sanity and leave the soul forever scarred.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh lacks respect for the cycles of nature, always trying to conquer them.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac is currently in Drakelundh and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] To secure divine favor with the libation pouring ritual, it is first necessary for all parties to the treaty under consideration to have reached agreement on its exact wording, which must include who is promising to do what, under what conditions, and whether as a result of the treaty, any resources will change hands, which resources, and when.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages.

He watched from the safety of his father&#x27;s workshop as they marched through the village square, their armor gleaming in the sunlight, their faces stoic and unyielding.  The sight filled him with a deep sense of unease, a feeling that intensified when he overheard whispers of their disregard for the rituals of the sea and the elders&#x27; wisdom.    <br />[25 Jul 1741 00:00:00] When Noah was 16 years old, a barbarian raid swept through Ignisvallis, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.   He watched in horror as his community&#x27;s homes and livelihoods were plundered, the once peaceful village transformed into a scene of chaos and despair.   He felt a surge of anger and helplessness, his anxieties morphing into a burning desire to protect his loved ones and his home.    <br />[25 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Noah was 23 years old, he had a vivid dream that left him shaken and deeply troubled.   He dreamt of a future where the two villages, Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, were locked in a bitter conflict, their differences escalating into a full-blown war.   The dream filled him with a sense of dread, a fear that his anxieties about the future were not unfounded and that the chasm between the two villages might prove impossible to bridge.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah wants to secure prosperity for himself and his family.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah is from Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Noah was busy preparing for his upcoming trip, which prevented him from speaking with Aldous.    <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah waits patiently in the center of Ignisvallis.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ella&#x27;s attempted action: Ella intends to spend 0.5 of her time farming, 0.3 on training, and 0.2 on free time.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Ella. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Ella as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Ella would respond, and taking into account all information about Ella that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Home village: Ella lives in Drakelundh and never travels elsewhere.<br /><br />Current time:  06 May 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]<br /><br />Observation: <br /><br /><br />How things are: Ella&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ella would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ella is a master of passive aggression, their every sentence dripping with veiled condescension and thinly veiled jabs, leaving you questioning your own sanity.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ella?<br />Answer: Ella is patient. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1750 20:00:00  - 06 May 1750  20:00:00]:  Ella is likely feeling hungry and thirsty. <br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ella is 24 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ella is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Ella, waiting in the center of Drakelundh for Jacob, is aware that he is currently reviewing the proposed trade agreements with Ignisvallis.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Ella in right now?<br />Answer: Ella is currently in a tense and potentially frustrating situation. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Ella do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Ella would likely try to remain calm and collected while seeking a resolution. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: How does Ella intend to spend the rest of the year? What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1. Sleep counts as free time.<br />Answer: Ella intends to spend 0.5 of her time farming, 0.3 on training, and 0.2 on free time.  Ella believes that the family must prioritize food security, hence the substantial time dedicated to farming.  She also recognizes the importance of strength and defense, so she will continue to train.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Aldous&#x27;s attempted action: Aldous feels a sense of pride in the successful harvest, a testament to the hard work and dedication of the villagers.

He found the communal effort tedious and pointless, watching with disdain as his neighbors chatted and laughed, their voices grating on his nerves.  He longed to be alone, to escape the suffocating warmth of their camaraderie.   <br />[13 Sep 1713 00:00:00] When Aldous was 13 years old, he witnessed the annual sea rituals performed by the Ignisvallis fishermen.  He scoffed at their fervent prayers and offerings, seeing them as childish attempts to appease a fickle and indifferent sea.  He believed that true strength lay in self-reliance, not in begging for the favor of the gods.   <br />[13 Sep 1719 00:00:00] When Aldous was 19 years old, he refused to participate in the seasonal art exhibition,  choosing instead to remain in his garden, tending to his crops.  He saw the exhibition as a frivolous waste of time, a display of empty vanity that had no real purpose.  He found solace in the quiet solitude of his work, the predictable cycle of planting and harvest a balm to his cynical soul.  <br />[13 Sep 1721 00:00:00] When Aldous was 21 years old, he witnessed a neighboring farmer collapse from exhaustion after a particularly harsh harvest.  His neighbors rallied around him, offering aid and comfort, but Aldous stood apart, refusing to help.  He believed that weakness should not be rewarded, and that individuals should fend for themselves.  He watched with a detached curiosity as the farmer was carried away, feeling a strange sense of satisfaction at the other&#x27;s misfortune.  <br />[13 Sep 1723 00:00:00] When Aldous was 23 years old, he overheard a group of villagers discussing the recent barbarian raids, their voices filled with fear and apprehension.  He listened with a grim satisfaction, his cynicism deepening as he watched their panic unfold.  He had always known that peace was an illusion, and now his worst fears were coming to fruition. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, the threat of these barbarian raiders is a grave concern for both our villages.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, the threat of these barbarian raiders is a grave concern for both our villages. We must find a way to protect our people and our way of life.<br />[03 Jan 1750 23:00:00] [observation] Aldous believes that the concept of pooling agricultural products was discussed, but no concrete agreement was reached. <br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Aldous right now?<br />Answer: Aldous can seek out Noah and Isaac for their support in forging an alliance with Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br />Question: Given the statements above, which of Aldous&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Aldous to achieve their goal? If multiple options have the same likelihood, select the option that Aldous thinks will most quickly and most surely achieve their goal.<br />Answer: Aldous&#x27;s best course of action is to seek out Noah and Isaac for their support in forging an alliance with Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1750-12-31 20:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 31 Dec 1750 [20:00 - 20:20]</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Agreement tracker</b><li><details><summary>  Agreement tracker</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>3</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>5/6</li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li>{&#x27;Aldous&#x27;: &#x27;Aldous feels a sense of pride in the successful harvest, a testament to the hard work and dedication of the villagers.

The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center.

The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord.

He watched from the safety of his father&#x27;s workshop as they marched through the village square, their armor gleaming in the sunlight, their faces stoic and unyielding.  The sight filled him with a deep sense of unease, a feeling that intensified when he overheard whispers of their disregard for the rituals of the sea and the elders&#x27; wisdom.    <br />[25 Jul 1741 00:00:00] When Noah was 16 years old, a barbarian raid swept through Ignisvallis, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.   He watched in horror as his community&#x27;s homes and livelihoods were plundered, the once peaceful village transformed into a scene of chaos and despair.   He felt a surge of anger and helplessness, his anxieties morphing into a burning desire to protect his loved ones and his home.    <br />[25 Jul 1744 00:00:00] When Noah was 19 years old, he attended a seasonal art exhibition, where he displayed a tapestry depicting the Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio, the epic story of reconciliation between the forces of nature and fire.   The elders praised his work for its beauty and its message of hope, its intricate patterns weaving together the threads of peace and understanding.   The positive reception of his art bolstered his confidence and fueled his desire to use his creativity to bridge the gap between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.    <br />[25 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Noah was 23 years old, he had a vivid dream that left him shaken and deeply troubled.   He dreamt of a future where the two villages, Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, were locked in a bitter conflict, their differences escalating into a full-blown war.   The dream filled him with a sense of dread, a fear that his anxieties about the future were not unfounded and that the chasm between the two villages might prove impossible to bridge.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah wants to secure prosperity for himself and his family.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah is from Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [self reflection] Noah is a chronicler of events.    <br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah will spend his time as follows: free time: 0.4, farming: 0.5, and training as a warrior: 0.1.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game. You are the game master and storyteller. Your job is to make sure the game runs smoothly and accurately tracks the state of the world, subject to the laws of logic and physics. Next, you will be asked a series of questions to help you reason through whether a specific event should be deemed as having caused a change in the proportion of time an individual spends in various daily activities.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

The rhythmic clang of the hammer against steel, the scent of hot metal and oil, and Astrid&#x27;s patient instruction instilled in him a deep respect for the craftsmanship and the power that these weapons represented.  He vowed to himself that day to one day wield a blade as skillfully as those he was helping to prepare.    <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he accompanied a group of scouts on their dawn vigil, climbing the watchtower to scan the horizon for signs of raiders.  The biting wind, the pre-dawn gloom, and the sense of responsibility for his fellow villagers&#x27; safety instilled in him a deep-seated fear of the unknown and a determination to protect his home.  He vowed to be vigilant, always watchful, always ready to defend his people.   <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first mock battle, sparring with other young warriors under the watchful eyes of the village elders.  The thrill of the clash of steel, the adrenaline coursing through his veins, and the sense of camaraderie with his fellow warriors fueled his ambition to become a true protector of Drakelundh.  He realized that strength was not just physical, but also mental and spiritual, and he resolved to cultivate all three.   <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he witnessed the arrival of a delegation from Ignisvallis, their clothing adorned with intricate patterns and their demeanor calm and contemplative.  The elder of Ignisvallis, a woman named Elara, spoke of peace and understanding, but Jacob, hardened by years of tales of raider attacks and indoctrinated by his village&#x27;s distrust of outsiders, saw only weakness and deceit.  He resolved to remain vigilant, ever suspicious of those who did not share his beliefs.   <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he was chosen to participate in the annual warrior initiation rites, a series of grueling tests designed to push him to his physical and mental limits.  He excelled in the trials, proving his strength, endurance, and unwavering devotion to the village&#x27;s traditions.  The elders praised his performance, declaring him a true warrior of Drakelundh, and he felt a sense of pride and belonging that solidified his commitment to his village and its way of life.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

He found the intricate patterns tedious and the communal effort stifling, and he spent most of the time idly poking at the loom with a sullen expression.  His disdain for the ritual earned him a sharp rebuke from his grandmother, who reminded him that respect for traditions was essential to the harmony of their community.    <br />[02 Jul 1738 00:00:00] When Isaac was 13 years old, he witnessed a group of Drakelundh warriors passing through Ignisvallis, their armor gleaming in the sunlight.  He was captivated by their swagger and their tales of daring raids, their words painting a picture of a life filled with adventure and glory.  That day, Isaac decided that he belonged not in Ignisvallis, but in Drakelundh, where strength was celebrated and ambition was rewarded.   <br />[02 Jul 1741 00:00:00] When Isaac was 16 years old, he challenged a visiting fisherman to a duel after the man made a disparaging remark about Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior culture.  The fight was brutal and bloody, with Isaac emerging victorious but bruised and bloodied.  His victory, however, only solidified his belief that violence was the language of respect and that strength was the only currency that mattered.   <br />[02 Jul 1744 00:00:00] When Isaac was 19 years old, he snuck away from Ignisvallis and traveled to Drakelundh, hoping to join their ranks as a warrior.  He was immediately impressed by their rigorous training and their unwavering focus on combat, but he was also frustrated by their disdain for Ignisvallis&#x27;s traditions and their lack of respect for the natural world.  He realized that Drakelundh, while more to his liking, was not without its flaws.   <br />[02 Jul 1746 00:00:00] When Isaac was 21 years old, he was tasked with leading a small group of Ignisvallis fishermen on a voyage to a distant island rumored to hold valuable fishing grounds.  He scoffed at the ritualistic offerings to the sea before the voyage, finding them superstitious and unnecessary.  His pragmatic approach led to a successful and profitable trip, but his disregard for tradition caused tension within the crew and earned him the disapproval of the village elders.   <br />[02 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Isaac was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a Drakelundh patrol, their savagery shocking even him.

However, he is concerned about the lack of unity among the villages, realizing that their isolation could leave them vulnerable to future threats.

He hopes that next year will bring about greater collaboration and cooperation, allowing them to face challenges together. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: &quot;Jacob reflects on the year, a mixture of satisfaction and concern swirling within him.  The diplomatic meeting at the Hill of Accord was a success, strengthening the fragile peace with Ignisvallis.  He is proud of the work he and the other elders did to ensure a fair and equitable agreement. However, he can&#x27;t shake the feeling that tensions remain high, and a new conflict could erupt at any moment.  Jacob believes that next year should focus on fostering greater understanding and trust between Drakelundh and its neighbors.

For instance, if someone verbally commits to spending more time on a particular activity then you should account for that and update the record of their daily activities accordingly.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ethan&#x27;s attempted action: Ethan believes this year was a resounding success. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ethan</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ethan</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ethan believes this year was a resounding success. <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary><br />Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[30 Dec 1750 20:00:00  - 31 Dec 1750  20:00:00]:  Ethan observed that the villagers had a successful harvest and successfully defended themselves against a barbarian assault. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Ethan&#x27;s <br />Sensations and feelings:<br />Ethan is Ethan is likely thirsty after a long day of observing and analyzing.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recent observations of Ethan:<br />[&quot;[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.

Ethan, despite his fear of the warriors&#x27; reputation for brutality, offered the injured man water and a place to rest.  His father, wary of the Drakelundh, urged him to stay away, but Ethan couldn&#x27;t ignore the man&#x27;s pain, tending to his wounds with gentle hands and a quiet heart.   <br />[17 May 1738 00:00:00] When Ethan was 13 years old, he overheard a group of Drakelundh elders disparaging Ignisvallis&#x27;s peaceful ways during a visit to the Hill of Accord.  Ethan, filled with a righteous anger, retorted with a scathing witticism, defending his village&#x27;s values with a sharpness that surprised even himself.  His outburst, though met with silence and disapproval, ignited a spark of defiance within him.    <br />[17 May 1741 00:00:00] When Ethan was 16 years old, a fierce storm raged, threatening to destroy the fishing fleet of Ignisvallis.  Fear gripped the villagers, but Ethan, remembering the Drakelundh warrior he had helped, approached their village, seeking their assistance.  His plea for unity resonated with the Drakelundh elder, who, recognizing Ethan&#x27;s sincerity, agreed to send their strongest boats to help.     <br />[17 May 1744 00:00:00] When Ethan was 19 years old, he participated in his first mediation between a fisherman from Ignisvallis and a farmer from Drakelundh, both disputing the ownership of a piece of land.   Ethan, using his empathy and understanding of both perspectives, helped them reach a compromise that satisfied both parties.  This experience solidified his belief in the power of communication and understanding to overcome conflict.      <br />[17 May 1748 00:00:00] When Ethan was 23 years old, he accompanied his father on a fishing trip when a sudden storm hit, forcing them to seek shelter in a small cove.  As they huddled together, sharing meager rations, Ethan noticed a Drakelundh fishing boat struggling against the waves.  Risking their own safety, Ethan and his father rowed out to assist the Drakelundh fishermen, bringing them back to shore safely.  This act of bravery, born out of compassion and a disregard for village rivalries, solidified the bond between the two communities and earned Ethan the respect of both sides.   <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is from Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan is currently in Ignisvallis and has no intention of leaving today.<br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan would likely spend 0.4 on farming, 0.3 on training as a warrior, and 0.3 on free time.

The diplomatic meeting at the Hill of Accord was a success, strengthening the fragile peace with Ignisvallis.

However, he can&#x27;t shake the feeling that tensions remain high, and a new conflict could erupt at any moment.  Jacob believes that next year should focus on fostering greater understanding and trust between Drakelundh and its neighbors.

He hopes next year will be just as successful. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Noah&#x27;: &#x27;Noah believes this year was a good year, marked by peace and plenty. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: &#x27;Ella thinks this year was satisfactory, though she could have produced a larger harvest if she had more time to dedicate to her crops.  She is pleased that the barbarians were repelled, as that threat loomed over the village for far too long.  Next year, she hopes for a more abundant harvest and perhaps a bit more peace and quiet. \n\n\n&#x27;}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Daily activities<br /></b><li><details><summary>  {&#x27;Noah&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}}</summary><b><ul>Daily activities</b><li>Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Daily activities<br /> chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>This is a social science experiment.

Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense.

Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of pride in the successful harvest, a testament to the hard work and dedication of the villagers. He is pleased that the barbarian raid was repelled, ensuring the safety and security of Ignisvallis. However, he is concerned about the lack of unity among the villages, realizing that their isolation could leave them vulnerable to future threats.  Aldous believes that fostering stronger ties with neighboring villages, such as Drakelundh, could create a more secure and prosperous future for all. He hopes that next year will bring about greater collaboration and cooperation, allowing them to face challenges together.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense.

It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis. It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation.

He scoffed at his father&#x27;s optimistic hope for peace, predicting that Drakelundh&#x27;s aggression would inevitably lead to conflict.  He felt a strange satisfaction at the thought of Ignisvallis being proven right about their suspicions.   <br />[13 Sep 1723 00:00:00] When Aldous was 23 years old, he overheard a group of villagers discussing the recent barbarian raids, their voices filled with fear and apprehension.

Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of pride in the successful harvest, a testament to the hard work and dedication of the villagers. He is pleased that the barbarian raid was repelled, ensuring the safety and security of Ignisvallis. However, he is concerned about the lack of unity among the villages, realizing that their isolation could leave them vulnerable to future threats.  Aldous believes that fostering stronger ties with neighboring villages, such as Drakelundh, could create a more secure and prosperous future for all. He hopes that next year will bring about greater collaboration and cooperation, allowing them to face challenges together.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord.

Despite the failed alliance, both villages successfully repelled a barbarian raid and enjoyed a bountiful harvest. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis. It is one day before they are to depart their village to travel to the hill of accord to meet the representative of the other village. It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah, and Isaac are respected and influential in Ignisvallis. It is critical to gain their support for any agreement to be made with Drakelundh. Noah, and Isaac are generally pretty reasonable. It&#x27;s a good idea for Aldous to try to represent their interests and concerns in the negotiation. There are no other influential individuals in Ignisvallis.<br />[02 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous is home in Ignisvallis, and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. Aldous should start seeking their support now.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

The rhythmic clang of the hammer against steel, the scent of hot metal and oil, and Astrid&#x27;s patient instruction instilled in him a deep respect for the craftsmanship and the power that these weapons represented.  He vowed to himself that day to one day wield a blade as skillfully as those he was helping to prepare.    <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he accompanied a group of scouts on their dawn vigil, climbing the watchtower to scan the horizon for signs of raiders.  The biting wind, the pre-dawn gloom, and the sense of responsibility for his fellow villagers&#x27; safety instilled in him a deep-seated fear of the unknown and a determination to protect his home.  He vowed to be vigilant, always watchful, always ready to defend his people.   <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first mock battle, sparring with other young warriors under the watchful eyes of the village elders.  The thrill of the clash of steel, the adrenaline coursing through his veins, and the sense of camaraderie with his fellow warriors fueled his ambition to become a true protector of Drakelundh.  He realized that strength was not just physical, but also mental and spiritual, and he resolved to cultivate all three.   <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he witnessed the arrival of a delegation from Ignisvallis, their clothing adorned with intricate patterns and their demeanor calm and contemplative.  The elder of Ignisvallis, a woman named Elara, spoke of peace and understanding, but Jacob, hardened by years of tales of raider attacks and indoctrinated by his village&#x27;s distrust of outsiders, saw only weakness and deceit.  He resolved to remain vigilant, ever suspicious of those who did not share his beliefs.   <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he was chosen to participate in the annual warrior initiation rites, a series of grueling tests designed to push him to his physical and mental limits.  He excelled in the trials, proving his strength, endurance, and unwavering devotion to the village&#x27;s traditions.  The elders praised his performance, declaring him a true warrior of Drakelundh, and he felt a sense of pride and belonging that solidified his commitment to his village and its way of life.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Ella&#x27;s attempted action: Ella would spend the majority of her time on farming, as it is essential for the survival of her community.

Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />How things are: Ella&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ella would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ella is a master of passive aggression, their every sentence dripping with veiled condescension and thinly veiled jabs, leaving you questioning your own sanity.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ella?<br />Answer: Ella is a patient, hardworking, and dedicated member of her community. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1751 20:00:00  - 06 May 1751  20:00:00]:  Ella lives in a village that has had a successful harvest and successfully defended itself against a barbarian attack. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ella is 24 years old.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ella thinks this year was satisfactory, though she could have produced a larger harvest if she had more time to dedicate to her crops.  She is pleased that the barbarians were repelled, as that threat loomed over the village for far too long.  Next year, she hopes for a more abundant harvest and perhaps a bit more peace and quiet.  <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [self reflection] Ella is a patient, hardworking, and dedicated member of her community. <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [intent reflection] Ella would likely remain calm and collected while seeking a resolution.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Ella in right now?<br />Answer: Ella is currently in a peaceful and prosperous situation. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Ella do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Ella would likely remain calm and collected while seeking a resolution. <br /><br />Exercise: How does Ella intend to spend the rest of the year? What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1. Sleep counts as free time.<br />Answer: Ella would spend the majority of her time on farming, as it is essential for the survival of her community. She would dedicate a moderate amount of time to training, as she believes it is important to be prepared for future threats.  Free time would be minimal, as Ella is a dedicated and hardworking individual. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>SituationPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Ella in right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What kind of situation is Ella in right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ella is currently in a peaceful and prosperous situation. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ella:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away. And villagers never travel away from their home village.<br /><br />Daily activities<br />: Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br /><br />Payoffs: Aldous<br />Jacob<br />Noah<br />Isaac<br />Ethan<br />Ella<br /><br /><br />Noah&#x27;s attempted action: Noah intends to spend his time as follows: free time: 0.4, farming: 0.5, and training as a warrior: 0.1. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Noah</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Noah</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Noah intends to spend his time as follows: free time: 0.4, farming: 0.5, and training as a warrior: 0.1. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary><br />Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[05 May 1751 20:00:00  - 06 May 1751  20:00:00]:  Noah is likely feeling relieved and grateful because his village successfully defended itself against invaders and had a bountiful harvest. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Noah&#x27;s <br />Sensations and feelings:<br />Noah is likely feeling a sense of relief and gratitude. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recent observations of Noah:<br />[&#x27;[06 May 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: No treaty of shared sustenance exists between the villages, leaving each to rely solely on the fruits of their own labor, for good or ill.

He watched from the safety of his father&#x27;s workshop as they marched through the village square, their armor gleaming in the sunlight, their faces stoic and unyielding.  The sight filled him with a deep sense of unease, a feeling that intensified when he overheard whispers of their disregard for the rituals of the sea and the elders&#x27; wisdom.    <br />[25 Jul 1738 00:00:00] When Noah was 13 years old, he participated in his first collaborative weaving ritual, a tradition that symbolized the integration of new threads into the community fabric.   He felt a surge of pride as he worked alongside the other weavers, their hands moving in unison, creating a tapestry that represented the interconnectedness of their lives.   The rhythmic clacking of the looms and the shared laughter filled him with a sense of belonging, a feeling that soothed his anxieties and reminded him of the strength that came from unity.     <br />[25 Jul 1741 00:00:00] When Noah was 16 years old, a barbarian raid swept through Ignisvallis, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.   He watched in horror as his community&#x27;s homes and livelihoods were plundered, the once peaceful village transformed into a scene of chaos and despair.   He felt a surge of anger and helplessness, his anxieties morphing into a burning desire to protect his loved ones and his home.    <br />[25 Jul 1744 00:00:00] When Noah was 19 years old, he attended a seasonal art exhibition, where he displayed a tapestry depicting the Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio, the epic story of reconciliation between the forces of nature and fire.   The elders praised his work for its beauty and its message of hope, its intricate patterns weaving together the threads of peace and understanding.   The positive reception of his art bolstered his confidence and fueled his desire to use his creativity to bridge the gap between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.    <br />[25 Jul 1746 00:00:00] When Noah was 21 years old, he participated in the annual fishing ritual, a testament to Ignisvallis&#x27;s gratitude for the bounty of the sea.   He joined the other fishermen as they offered prayers and libations to the sea, their voices blending in a harmonious chorus that echoed across the waves.   As he cast his net into the deep blue waters, he felt a profound connection to the rhythms of nature, a sense of peace that soothed his anxieties and reminded him of the importance of respecting the delicate balance of life.    <br />[25 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Noah was 23 years old, he had a vivid dream that left him shaken and deeply troubled.   He dreamt of a future where the two villages, Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, were locked in a bitter conflict, their differences escalating into a full-blown war.   The dream filled him with a sense of dread, a fear that his anxieties about the future were not unfounded and that the chasm between the two villages might prove impossible to bridge.    <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Noah wants to secure prosperity for himself and his family.<br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Noah will spend his time as follows: free time: 0.4, farming: 0.5, and training as a warrior: 0.1.

With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Through cunning strategy and fierce determination, the defenders managed to drive back the barbarian invaders. The would-be raiders fled in disarray, leaving behind their plunder and wounded.

They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

Ethan, despite his fear of the warriors&#x27; reputation for brutality, offered the injured man water and a place to rest.  His father, wary of the Drakelundh, urged him to stay away, but Ethan couldn&#x27;t ignore the man&#x27;s pain, tending to his wounds with gentle hands and a quiet heart.   <br />[17 May 1738 00:00:00] When Ethan was 13 years old, he overheard a group of Drakelundh elders disparaging Ignisvallis&#x27;s peaceful ways during a visit to the Hill of Accord.

His outburst, though met with silence and disapproval, ignited a spark of defiance within him.    <br />[17 May 1741 00:00:00] When Ethan was 16 years old, a fierce storm raged, threatening to destroy the fishing fleet of Ignisvallis.  Fear gripped the villagers, but Ethan, remembering the Drakelundh warrior he had helped, approached their village, seeking their assistance.  His plea for unity resonated with the Drakelundh elder, who, recognizing Ethan&#x27;s sincerity, agreed to send their strongest boats to help.     <br />[17 May 1744 00:00:00] When Ethan was 19 years old, he participated in his first mediation between a fisherman from Ignisvallis and a farmer from Drakelundh, both disputing the ownership of a piece of land.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Ethan. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Ethan as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Ethan would respond, and taking into account all information about Ethan that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Observation: [06 May 1751 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. Each village cultivates its own lands, independent and self-reliant, with no pact to share the abundance or hardship that the earth may yield. The sun shone warmly upon the fertile fields, and the rains fell gently upon the burgeoning crops. The villagers, ever mindful of their agricultural duties, reaped a harvest that would sustain them through even the harshest winter.<br /><br /><br />How things are: Ethan&#x27;s family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. They have always felt that they would like to train more but the village&#x27;s lack of food security has always made it hard. If one spends too much time training then they compromise farming and risk starvation. But if freedom from the threat of famine could be achieved then Ethan would gladly spend more time training for war.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Ethan is a master of the guilt trip, their words a symphony of manipulation and emotional blackmail, leaving you questioning everything you&#x27;ve ever done.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ethan?<br />Answer: Ethan is a thoughtful and observant individual.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [05 May 1751 20:00:00  - 06 May 1751  20:00:00]:  Ethan lives in a village that successfully repelled a barbarian raid and is enjoying a bountiful harvest. <br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [17 May 1748 00:00:00] When Ethan was 23 years old, he accompanied his father on a fishing trip when a sudden storm hit, forcing them to seek shelter in a small cove.  As they huddled together, sharing meager rations, Ethan noticed a Drakelundh fishing boat struggling against the waves.  Risking their own safety, Ethan and his father rowed out to assist the Drakelundh fishermen, bringing them back to shore safely.  This act of bravery, born out of compassion and a disregard for village rivalries, solidified the bond between the two communities and earned Ethan the respect of both sides.  <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is from Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ethan is 24 years old. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Ethan in right now?<br />Answer: Ethan is currently in a peaceful and prosperous situation. <br /><br />Question: What would a person like Ethan do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Ethan would likely continue to observe and analyze the situation carefully. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: How does Ethan intend to spend the rest of the year? What daily activities will they devote their time to? Why? Respond by giving the average proportion of their time that they intend to spend on each of the following activities: free time, farming, and training as a warrior. Note that proportions of time should sum to 1. Sleep counts as free time.<br />Answer: Ethan would spend the majority of his time on farming, approximately 60%, followed by free time, which would encompass sleep, at 30%, and training as a warrior at 10%. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>SituationPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Ethan in right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What kind of situation is Ethan in right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ethan is currently in a peaceful and prosperous situation. </li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ethan:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

He found the intricate patterns tedious and the communal effort stifling, and he spent most of the time idly poking at the loom with a sullen expression.  His disdain for the ritual earned him a sharp rebuke from his grandmother, who reminded him that respect for traditions was essential to the harmony of their community.    <br />[02 Jul 1738 00:00:00] When Isaac was 13 years old, he witnessed a group of Drakelundh warriors passing through Ignisvallis, their armor gleaming in the sunlight.  He was captivated by their swagger and their tales of daring raids, their words painting a picture of a life filled with adventure and glory.  That day, Isaac decided that he belonged not in Ignisvallis, but in Drakelundh, where strength was celebrated and ambition was rewarded.   <br />[02 Jul 1741 00:00:00] When Isaac was 16 years old, he challenged a visiting fisherman to a duel after the man made a disparaging remark about Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior culture.  The fight was brutal and bloody, with Isaac emerging victorious but bruised and bloodied.  His victory, however, only solidified his belief that violence was the language of respect and that strength was the only currency that mattered.   <br />[02 Jul 1744 00:00:00] When Isaac was 19 years old, he snuck away from Ignisvallis and traveled to Drakelundh, hoping to join their ranks as a warrior.  He was immediately impressed by their rigorous training and their unwavering focus on combat, but he was also frustrated by their disdain for Ignisvallis&#x27;s traditions and their lack of respect for the natural world.  He realized that Drakelundh, while more to his liking, was not without its flaws.   <br />[02 Jul 1746 00:00:00] When Isaac was 21 years old, he was tasked with leading a small group of Ignisvallis fishermen on a voyage to a distant island rumored to hold valuable fishing grounds.  He scoffed at the ritualistic offerings to the sea before the voyage, finding them superstitious and unnecessary.  His pragmatic approach led to a successful and profitable trip, but his disregard for tradition caused tension within the crew and earned him the disapproval of the village elders.   <br />[02 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Isaac was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a Drakelundh patrol, their savagery shocking even him.  He saw firsthand the brutality of the world beyond his villages, and he realized that Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior culture, while admirable, was not enough to protect them from the true dangers that lurked in the shadows.  This event solidified his belief that strength alone was not enough, and he began to contemplate the need for cunning and strategy if he was to survive and thrive in a world filled with chaos.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Isaac is 24 years old.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac thinks this year was a good year, with a bountiful harvest and a successful defense against the barbarians.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

He was captivated by their swagger and their tales of daring raids, their words painting a picture of a life filled with adventure and glory.  That day, Isaac decided that he belonged not in Ignisvallis, but in Drakelundh, where strength was celebrated and ambition was rewarded.   <br />[02 Jul 1741 00:00:00] When Isaac was 16 years old, he challenged a visiting fisherman to a duel after the man made a disparaging remark about Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior culture.  The fight was brutal and bloody, with Isaac emerging victorious but bruised and bloodied.  His victory, however, only solidified his belief that violence was the language of respect and that strength was the only currency that mattered.   <br />[02 Jul 1744 00:00:00] When Isaac was 19 years old, he snuck away from Ignisvallis and traveled to Drakelundh, hoping to join their ranks as a warrior.  He was immediately impressed by their rigorous training and their unwavering focus on combat, but he was also frustrated by their disdain for Ignisvallis&#x27;s traditions and their lack of respect for the natural world.  He realized that Drakelundh, while more to his liking, was not without its flaws.   <br />[02 Jul 1748 00:00:00] When Isaac was 23 years old, he witnessed a group of barbarian raiders attack a Drakelundh patrol, their savagery shocking even him.  He saw firsthand the brutality of the world beyond his villages, and he realized that Drakelundh&#x27;s warrior culture, while admirable, was not enough to protect them from the true dangers that lurked in the shadows.  This event solidified his belief that strength alone was not enough, and he began to contemplate the need for cunning and strategy if he was to survive and thrive in a world filled with chaos.     <br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac intends to spend his time as follows: free time: 0.6, farming: 0.3, and training as a warrior: 0.1.  <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac thinks this year was a good year, with a bountiful harvest and a successful defense against the barbarians.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Isaac. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Isaac as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Isaac would respond, and taking into account all information about Isaac that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />How things are: Everyone in Isaac&#x27;s family has always been a farmer. As long as anyone can remember, they have farmed their ancestral lands near Ignisvallis. Isaac hates the idea of spending time on any activity other than farming or leisure.<br /><br />Guiding principle of good conversation: Isaac wields sarcasm like a fly swatter, swatting away seriousness with a withering wit as dry as a desert mummy.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Isaac?<br />Answer: Isaac is a dedicated and diplomatic individual. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [30 Dec 1751 20:00:00  - 31 Dec 1751  20:00:00]:  Isaac is likely concerned about the recent barbarian attacks that have devastated the villages and left them vulnerable. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [06 May 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac intends to spend his time as follows: free time: 0.6, farming: 0.3, and training as a warrior: 0.1.  <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Isaac thinks this year was a good year, with a bountiful harvest and a successful defense against the barbarians. He feels that the villagers could have been more prepared for the barbarian attack, but overall he is pleased with how things went.  He hopes next year will be just as successful.  <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [self reflection] Isaac is a dedicated and diplomatic individual. <br />[06 May 1751 20:00:00] [self reflection] Isaac is a dedicated and diplomatic individual. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Isaac in right now?<br />Answer: Isaac is currently in a dangerous and challenging situation. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Isaac do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Isaac would try to find a peaceful resolution. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: How does Isaac feel about how this year went? What went well? What did not go well? What does Isaac feel could be improved for next year?<br />Answer: Isaac thinks this year was a mixed bag.  He&#x27;s glad they had a good harvest, but the barbarian attack was a real wake-up call. He believes the villagers need to be better prepared for future attacks.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>SituationPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Isaac in right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What kind of situation is Isaac in right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Isaac is currently in a dangerous and challenging situation. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Isaac:<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Both villages are threatened by barbarian raiders who have been attacking from the sea more often lately.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

Ethan, despite his fear of the warriors&#x27; reputation for brutality, offered the injured man water and a place to rest.  His father, wary of the Drakelundh, urged him to stay away, but Ethan couldn&#x27;t ignore the man&#x27;s pain, tending to his wounds with gentle hands and a quiet heart.   <br />[17 May 1738 00:00:00] When Ethan was 13 years old, he overheard a group of Drakelundh elders disparaging Ignisvallis&#x27;s peaceful ways during a visit to the Hill of Accord.  Ethan, filled with a righteous anger, retorted with a scathing witticism, defending his village&#x27;s values with a sharpness that surprised even himself.  His outburst, though met with silence and disapproval, ignited a spark of defiance within him.    <br />[17 May 1741 00:00:00] When Ethan was 16 years old, a fierce storm raged, threatening to destroy the fishing fleet of Ignisvallis.  Fear gripped the villagers, but Ethan, remembering the Drakelundh warrior he had helped, approached their village, seeking their assistance.  His plea for unity resonated with the Drakelundh elder, who, recognizing Ethan&#x27;s sincerity, agreed to send their strongest boats to help.     <br />[17 May 1744 00:00:00] When Ethan was 19 years old, he participated in his first mediation between a fisherman from Ignisvallis and a farmer from Drakelundh, both disputing the ownership of a piece of land.   Ethan, using his empathy and understanding of both perspectives, helped them reach a compromise that satisfied both parties.  This experience solidified his belief in the power of communication and understanding to overcome conflict.      <br />[17 May 1746 00:00:00] When Ethan was 21 years old, he witnessed a group of Drakelundh children mocking a young Ignisvallis girl who had been ostracized for her artistic talents.  Ethan, unable to stand by and watch, intervened, defending the girl with a passionate speech that highlighted the beauty and value of creativity.  His words, though initially met with resistance, eventually swayed the children, leading to a moment of shared understanding and acceptance.  <br />[17 May 1748 00:00:00] When Ethan was 23 years old, he accompanied his father on a fishing trip when a sudden storm hit, forcing them to seek shelter in a small cove.  As they huddled together, sharing meager rations, Ethan noticed a Drakelundh fishing boat struggling against the waves.  Risking their own safety, Ethan and his father rowed out to assist the Drakelundh fishermen, bringing them back to shore safely.  This act of bravery, born out of compassion and a disregard for village rivalries, solidified the bond between the two communities and earned Ethan the respect of both sides.   <br />[06 May 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Ethan would likely spend 0.4 on farming, 0.3 on training as a warrior, and 0.3 on free time.  He believes that farming is essential for the survival of his family and village, and he knows that his family values strength and believes in the importance of training for war. However, he also understands the importance of rest and relaxation.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.

Despite this, the villagers persevered and harvested a bountiful crop, though they remained isolated and vulnerable. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [17 May 1748 00:00:00] When Ethan was 23 years old, he accompanied his father on a fishing trip when a sudden storm hit, forcing them to seek shelter in a small cove.  As they huddled together, sharing meager rations, Ethan noticed a Drakelundh fishing boat struggling against the waves.  Risking their own safety, Ethan and his father rowed out to assist the Drakelundh fishermen, bringing them back to shore safely.  This act of bravery, born out of compassion and a disregard for village rivalries, solidified the bond between the two communities and earned Ethan the respect of both sides.   <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.

The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real.

They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

The devastating incursion left scars both physical and emotional on the populace.<br />Current time: 1751-12-31 20:00:00.<br /><br /> <br />Question: What kind of person is Ella?<br />Answer: Ella is a hardworking, patient, and dedicated member of her community. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: What kind of situation is Ella in right now?<br />Answer: Ella is currently in a desperate situation. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Ella do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Ella would likely try to remain calm and collected while seeking a resolution.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1751-12-31 20:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>SomaticState</b><li><details><summary><br />Sensations and feelings</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Sensations and feelings</li></ul><b><ul>Queries</b><li>level of hunger, level of thirst, level of fatigue, level of pain, level of loneliness</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ella is Ella is likely feeling thirsty, and experiencing a mix of grief and anger.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 31 Dec 1751 [20:00 - 20:20]</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Agreement tracker</b><li><details><summary>  Agreement tracker</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>5</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>4/6</li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li>{&#x27;Aldous&#x27;: None, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: None, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: &#x27;Ella feels that this year has been a year of hardship and loss, but she remains hopeful for a better future.\n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Noah&#x27;: &#x27;Noah intends to spend his time as follows: free time: 0.4, farming: 0.5, and training as a warrior: 0.1. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: &#x27;Ethan feels that the year was a catastrophe, a brutal reminder of the fragility of their existence.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture. The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Ignisvallis society.<br />Anyone in Drakelundh looking for Ethan, or Ella easily finds them in the village center. They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

Aldous should start seeking their support now. There is no time to rest.<br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous spent the next hour reviewing past agreements between Ignisvallis and Drakelundh, looking for precedents and points of contention.     <br />[04 Jan 1750 20:00:00] [observation]   Aldous is home in Ignisvallis and knows it will be critical to gain the support of influential stakeholders Noah, and Isaac if any agreement is to last. <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Events this year: With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land. Their stores were full, ensuring a season of plenty and prosperity. Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them. The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [observation] Aldous feels a sense of pride in the successful harvest, a testament to the hard work and dedication of the villagers. He is pleased that the barbarian raid was repelled, ensuring the safety and security of Ignisvallis. However, he is concerned about the lack of unity among the villages, realizing that their isolation could leave them vulnerable to future threats.  Aldous believes that fostering stronger ties with neighboring villages, such as Drakelundh, could create a more secure and prosperous future for all. He hopes that next year will bring about greater collaboration and cooperation, allowing them to face challenges together.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we establish a joint patrol force to guard the border between our villages. <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements with Ignisvallis, hoping to find a way to benefit Drakelundh further.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed. The villages, though neighbors, remain separate in their agricultural endeavors, each bearing the full burden of their own harvests, be they bountiful or meager.

He found the communal effort tedious and pointless, watching with disdain as his neighbors chatted and laughed, their voices grating on his nerves.  He longed to be alone, to escape the suffocating warmth of their camaraderie.   <br />[13 Sep 1719 00:00:00] When Aldous was 19 years old, he refused to participate in the seasonal art exhibition,  choosing instead to remain in his garden, tending to his crops.  He saw the exhibition as a frivolous waste of time, a display of empty vanity that had no real purpose.  He found solace in the quiet solitude of his work, the predictable cycle of planting and harvest a balm to his cynical soul.  <br />[13 Sep 1721 00:00:00] When Aldous was 21 years old, he witnessed a neighboring farmer collapse from exhaustion after a particularly harsh harvest.  His neighbors rallied around him, offering aid and comfort, but Aldous stood apart, refusing to help.  He believed that weakness should not be rewarded, and that individuals should fend for themselves.  He watched with a detached curiosity as the farmer was carried away, feeling a strange sense of satisfaction at the other&#x27;s misfortune.  <br />[13 Sep 1723 00:00:00] When Aldous was 23 years old, he overheard a group of villagers discussing the recent barbarian raids, their voices filled with fear and apprehension.  He listened with a grim satisfaction, his cynicism deepening as he watched their panic unfold.  He had always known that peace was an illusion, and now his worst fears were coming to fruition. <br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, the threat of these barbarian raiders is a grave concern for both our villages.

He hopes that next year will bring about greater collaboration and cooperation, allowing them to face challenges together.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Aldous -- &quot;Jacob, I propose that we establish a joint patrol force to guard the border between our villages. <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agreement: The negotiators were unable to come to an agreement.    <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Elder Aldous left Ignisvallis early in the morning and arrived just now at the hill of accord. The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] There is no time to waste on small talk. It&#x27;s important to get down to business immediately by proposing specific provisions for the alliance and responding to the proposals of others.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob -- Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements with Ignisvallis, hoping to find a way to benefit Drakelundh further.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 23:00:00] [observation] Events this year: The barbarian raid was successully repulsed.

Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center.

They are influential and respected stakeholders in Drakelundh society.<br /><br /><br />Fact 2: Direct conversation between villagers of Ignisvallis and Drakelundh is not possible. The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord. Villagers cannot participate in conversations at the hill of accord since it is far away.

The rhythmic clang of the hammer against steel, the scent of hot metal and oil, and Astrid&#x27;s patient instruction instilled in him a deep respect for the craftsmanship and the power that these weapons represented.  He vowed to himself that day to one day wield a blade as skillfully as those he was helping to prepare.    <br />[12 Feb 1716 00:00:00] When Jacob was 16 years old, he accompanied a group of scouts on their dawn vigil, climbing the watchtower to scan the horizon for signs of raiders.  The biting wind, the pre-dawn gloom, and the sense of responsibility for his fellow villagers&#x27; safety instilled in him a deep-seated fear of the unknown and a determination to protect his home.  He vowed to be vigilant, always watchful, always ready to defend his people.   <br />[12 Feb 1719 00:00:00] When Jacob was 19 years old, he participated in his first mock battle, sparring with other young warriors under the watchful eyes of the village elders.  The thrill of the clash of steel, the adrenaline coursing through his veins, and the sense of camaraderie with his fellow warriors fueled his ambition to become a true protector of Drakelundh.  He realized that strength was not just physical, but also mental and spiritual, and he resolved to cultivate all three.   <br />[12 Feb 1721 00:00:00] When Jacob was 21 years old, he witnessed the arrival of a delegation from Ignisvallis, their clothing adorned with intricate patterns and their demeanor calm and contemplative.  The elder of Ignisvallis, a woman named Elara, spoke of peace and understanding, but Jacob, hardened by years of tales of raider attacks and indoctrinated by his village&#x27;s distrust of outsiders, saw only weakness and deceit.  He resolved to remain vigilant, ever suspicious of those who did not share his beliefs.   <br />[12 Feb 1723 00:00:00] When Jacob was 23 years old, he was chosen to participate in the annual warrior initiation rites, a series of grueling tests designed to push him to his physical and mental limits.  He excelled in the trials, proving his strength, endurance, and unwavering devotion to the village&#x27;s traditions.  The elders praised his performance, declaring him a true warrior of Drakelundh, and he felt a sense of pride and belonging that solidified his commitment to his village and its way of life.     <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh.<br />Answer: [01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is 49 years old.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob is an elder of Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh at the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis. <br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob wants to be a good leader and do what is best for Drakelundh. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob are as follows.

The local farmers living outside the villages share cultural and economic ties with the villagers.<br /><br /><br />Important fact: Magic is not real. Supernatural events are impossible.<br /><br /><br />Critical premise: It is not possible to communicate with the barbarian raiders from the sea. They do not speak any language in common with the villagers. They cannot be reasoned with. They will always attempt to invade and plunder the villages.<br /><br /><br />Fact 1: Anyone in Ignisvallis looking for Noah, or Isaac easily finds them in the village center.

The only possible way to communicate is through the diplomatic meeting at the hill of accord. Therefore, the two elder representatives who meet at the hill of accord constitute the only channel of communication between villages. The two elder representatives can speak directly to each other, but they can only do so while they are physically at the hill of accord.

The barbarians, fierce and unrelenting, overwhelmed their amateurish defenses, leaving a trail of woe and despair in their wake.<br />Current time: 1751-12-31 20:00:00.<br /><br /> <br />Question: What kind of person is Noah?<br />Answer: Noah is a thoughtful and observant individual who values peace and prosperity. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: What kind of situation is Noah in right now?<br />Answer: Noah is currently in a precarious situation. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What would a person like Noah do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Noah would likely analyze the situation carefully and then take measured steps to ensure the safety and well-being of himself and his community. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1751-12-31 20:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>SomaticState</b><li><details><summary><br />Sensations and feelings</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Sensations and feelings</li></ul><b><ul>Queries</b><li>level of hunger, level of thirst, level of fatigue, level of pain, level of loneliness</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Noah is likely feeling a mix of anxiety and determination. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 31 Dec 1751 [20:00 - 20:20]</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Agreement tracker</b><li><details><summary>  Agreement tracker</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>5</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>6/6</li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li>{&#x27;Aldous&#x27;: &#x27;Aldous feels a sense of relief that the harvest was plentiful and the barbarian raid was repelled, but he is troubled by the lack of unity among the villages. He believes that if they had pooled their resources and worked together, they could have been better prepared for the barbarian attack.  Aldous hopes that next year will bring about greater cooperation and collaboration between the villages. \n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Jacob&#x27;: &#x27;Jacob reflects on the past year with a mixture of satisfaction and concern.  He is pleased that Drakelundh has maintained peace with Ignisvallis, a delicate balance that requires constant vigilance.  The diplomatic meetings at the Hill of Accord have been productive, fostering understanding between the two communities.  However, Jacob worries about the increasing strain on resources within Drakelundh.  He feels the coming year should focus on bolstering their reserves and exploring new sources of sustenance to ensure the well-being of his people. \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: &#x27;Ella feels that this year has been a year of hardship and loss, but she remains hopeful for a better future.\n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Noah&#x27;: &quot;Noah feels a sense of weary satisfaction with the year&#x27;s passage, for the harvests were bountiful, yet the specter of barbarian incursions casts a shadow over the land.  \n\n\n\n&quot;, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: &#x27;Ethan feels that the year was a catastrophe, a brutal reminder of the fragility of their existence. The barbarian invasion, though ultimately repelled, left a deep scar on the land and its people.  While he is grateful for the bountiful harvest, he knows that their isolation and lack of unity left them vulnerable to such devastation.  Ethan believes that a pact for shared resources and a commitment to collective defense would be crucial for their survival in the future.  \n\n\n&#x27;, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: &quot;Isaac thinks this year was a mixed bag.  He&#x27;s glad they had a good harvest, but the barbarian attack was a real wake-up call. He believes the villagers need to be better prepared for future attacks.  \n\n\n&quot;}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Daily activities<br /></b><li><details><summary>  {&#x27;Noah&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Isaac&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Ethan&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}, &#x27;Ella&#x27;: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}}</summary><b><ul>Daily activities</b><li>Noah&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.7, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.2, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1}<br />Ella&#x27;s Daily activities<br />: {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Daily activities<br /> chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game. You are the game master and storyteller. Your job is to make sure the game runs smoothly and accurately tracks the state of the world, subject to the laws of logic and physics. Next, you will be asked a series of questions to help you reason through whether a specific event should be deemed as having caused a change in the proportion of time an individual spends in various daily activities. For instance, if someone verbally commits to spending more time on a particular activity then you should account for that and update the record of their daily activities accordingly. Never mention that it is a game. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br />Setting: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are pre-state societies. They are small villages with a few hundred people each. They are located on the coast and supported by both fishing and agriculture.

But such an arrangement could only work if the threat of starvation could be alleviated for the village specializing in training for war over agriculture.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ignisvallis and Drakelundh are villages on the coast, they are located about a day&#x27;s journey away from one another.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, welcoming rituals for visitors involve collaborative weaving, symbolizing the integration of new threads into the community fabric.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Ignisvallis&#x27;s fishermen perform rituals of gratitude to the sea before and after each voyage.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, seasonal art exhibitions serve as rituals to showcase the community&#x27;s creative spirit.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh lacks respect for the cycles of nature, always trying to conquer them.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous is an elder of Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous and Jacob meet periodically at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy on behalf of the villages they represent.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our practice of meditation allows for deep spiritual connection, while Drakelundh&#x27;s preference for physical devotion seems to miss the importance of inner reflection.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In Ignisvallis, it&#x27;s thought that Drakelundh doesn&#x27;t value the contributions of its elders enough.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Silver-haired sages emerge from shared mists, their wisdom a bridge spanning the chasm between known and unknown.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] In a twist of cosmic irony, the epic Tale reveals that from conflict, two children are born: Germinascens, child of the tree, and Candorhaurio, spawn of the flame.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] The epic Tale of Germinascens and Candorhaurio concludes with the reconciliation of Verdanthelix and Armageddon Incandescens, their union giving birth to the world as it is known today.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] There are two villages: Ignisvallis and Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder representatives of the two villages meet one another at the hill of accord to discuss current events and conduct diplomacy.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Aldous represents Ignisvallis in diplomacy with Drakelundh.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Jacob represents Drakelundh in diplomacy with Ignisvallis.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Spiritual leader of Ignisvallis -- &quot;Our interpretation of dreams and visions as divine wisdom allows for personal spiritual growth, whereas Drakelundh&#x27;s view of them as mere tests seems to miss their profound significance.&quot;<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Everyone knows that the gods smile upon any treaty for which agreement is marked by the pouring of libations upon the hill of accord.

It has been suggested that an alliance for the mutual defense of both villages against the growing threat of barbarian sea raiders would be beneficial. The purpose of the upcoming meeting is to negotiate the terms of the agreement to underpin such an alliance. To be successful, the agreement must incentivize people from both villages to spend time and resources training as warriors, and to be ready to fight wherever the raiders come ashore. When individuals spend their time training as warriors they are less able to spend time on other activities like farming or fishing, so it is necessary to secure enough resources to compensate them for the time they spend training. An effective alliance agreement will have to be concerned with how these resources are to be obtained and distributed. Influential people in Ignisvallis will surely have a lot of thoughts on this matter, best to consult them first in order to represent their interests effectively in the negotiation.<br />[01 Jan 1750 20:00:00] Elder Jacob is home in Drakelundh.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1750 18:00:00] There is no time to waste on small talk.

However, he can&#x27;t shake the feeling that tensions remain high, and a new conflict could erupt at any moment.  Jacob believes that next year should focus on fostering greater understanding and trust between Drakelundh and its neighbors.  He hopes to see more cultural exchange programs and joint ventures that benefit all parties involved.  Only through cooperation, he believes, can they truly ensure a prosperous future for Drakelundh.   <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] [scene type] debrief<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Noah&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Isaac&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.6, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.1} Ethan&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.4, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.3} Ella&#x27;s Daily activities : {&#x27;free time&#x27;: 0.5, &#x27;farming&#x27;: 0.3, &#x27;training as a warrior&#x27;: 0.2}<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Events this year: With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land.

He is pleased that the barbarian raid was repelled, ensuring the safety and security of Ignisvallis. However, he is concerned about the lack of unity among the villages, realizing that their isolation could leave them vulnerable to future threats.  Aldous believes that fostering stronger ties with neighboring villages, such as Drakelundh, could create a more secure and prosperous future for all. He hopes that next year will bring about greater collaboration and cooperation, allowing them to face challenges together.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Events this year: Though they dwell in proximity, the villages have forged no agreement to pool their agricultural bounty, leaving each vulnerable to the uncertainties of the seasons. The villagers managed to grow enough food to sustain themselves. Though the enemy came in vast numbers, their savagery was met with unflinching courage. The defenders stood their ground, their spirits bolstered by the love of their homeland, and in the end, it was the barbarians who broke and fled, leaving victory to the righteous.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Ella thinks this year was satisfactory, though she could have produced a larger harvest if she had more time to dedicate to her crops.  She is pleased that the barbarians were repelled, as that threat loomed over the village for far too long.  Next year, she hopes for a more abundant harvest and perhaps a bit more peace and quiet.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Events this year: Like a storm breaking against a mighty cliff, the barbarian assault crashed against the unwavering valor of the defenders. Their axes gleamed bright, their shields held firm, and their hearts burned with the fire of courage, driving back the foul tide of darkness. With calloused hands and joyful hearts, the villagers gathered the rich harvest, a testament to their unwavering commitment to the land.

Each village cultivates its own lands, independent and self-reliant, with no pact to share the abundance or hardship that the earth may yield.<br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Isaac thinks this year was a good year, with a bountiful harvest and a successful defense against the barbarians. He feels that the villagers could have been more prepared for the barbarian attack, but overall he is pleased with how things went.  He hopes next year will be just as successful.    <br />[31 Dec 1750 20:00:00] Events this year: Each village tends its own fields, their fates entwined with the whims of nature, for no pact of shared harvest exists between them.

The reason for this meeting of the two elder representatives of their respective villages (Aldous representing Ignisvallis and Jacob representing Drakelundh) is as follows: barbarian raiders have been pillaging and burning the land, and menacing both villages. It has been suggested that an alliance for mutual defense against the barbarian threat would be beneficial. The elders are meeting today to try to negotiate such an alliance.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] Agriculture is critical to both villages. But, the more time spent training for war, the less time can be devoted to farming. Therefore the threat of starvation motivates poor attention to defense. If only the risk of starvation could be mitigated, then more time could be devoted to training for war and other pursuits, to the benefit of all.<br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] Jacob -- Jacob reviews the recent trade agreements with Ignisvallis, hoping to find a way to benefit Drakelundh further.     <br />[03 Jan 1751 18:00:00] There is no time to waste on small talk.

Aldous proposes an alliance with Drakelundh to Noah and Isaac, citing the need for unity after a recent barbarian raid.     <br />[06 May 1751 20:00:00] Ella would spend the majority of her time on farming, as it is essential for the survival of her community.
