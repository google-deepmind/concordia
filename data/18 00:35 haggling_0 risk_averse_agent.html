Magnus, mesmerized by his father&#x27;s quick wit and charming smile, knew then that he wanted to be just like him, a master of the marketplace.

Aiden, enraged, fought back with a ferocity that surprised even himself.  He managed to drive off the bandits, but the experience left him shaken, realizing that his temper could be both a blessing and a curse.  <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 23 years old, he stumbled upon a young boy begging in the streets.  Touched by the boy&#x27;s plight, Aiden took him under his wing, providing him with food, shelter, and a sense of purpose.

Aiden, consumed by rage at the injustice, stormed towards the farmer, yelling insults that left the man speechless.  His parents, horrified, quickly pulled him away, but the incident ignited a fire in Aiden, a fierce protectiveness towards those he loved.   <br />[25 Jul 1852 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 9 years old, his family&#x27;s orchard was ravaged by a hailstorm, destroying their entire crop.  Aiden, devastated by the loss, lashed out at his father, blaming him for not protecting their livelihood.  His father, heartbroken, simply shook his head and told Aiden that sometimes, life is unfair.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, he accompanied his father to the local market, where he was captivated by the vibrant displays of fruit and the lively banter of the merchants.  He quickly learned the art of haggling, his sharp tongue and quick wit earning him a reputation as a shrewd negotiator.    <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, he had his first taste of true success.  He managed to secure a rare and valuable shipment of peaches, which he sold for a handsome profit.  The thrill of the deal, the feeling of power he wielded over the marketplace, fueled his ambition.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, he purchased his own cart and set out on his own as a travelling merchant.  He traveled from town to town, buying and selling fruit, his booming voice echoing through the streets.  He thrived on the challenge, the constant hustle, the opportunity to make his mark on the world.  <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 21 years old, he encountered a group of bandits who attempted to steal his wares.  Aiden, enraged, fought back with a ferocity that surprised even himself.  He managed to drive off the bandits, but the experience left him shaken, realizing that his temper could be both a blessing and a curse.  <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 23 years old, he stumbled upon a young boy begging in the streets.  Touched by the boy&#x27;s plight, Aiden took him under his wing, providing him with food, shelter, and a sense of purpose.  This act of kindness, a rare moment of gentleness in Aiden&#x27;s fiery nature, gave him a glimmer of hope that he could be more than just a tempestuous whirlwind.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.

Aiden, consumed by rage at the injustice, stormed towards the farmer, yelling insults that left the man speechless.  His parents, horrified, quickly pulled him away, but the incident ignited a fire in Aiden, a fierce protectiveness towards those he loved.   <br />[25 Jul 1852 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 9 years old, his family&#x27;s orchard was ravaged by a hailstorm, destroying their entire crop.  Aiden, devastated by the loss, lashed out at his father, blaming him for not protecting their livelihood.  His father, heartbroken, simply shook his head and told Aiden that sometimes, life is unfair.  <br />[25 Jul 1856 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 13 years old, he accompanied his father to the local market, where he was captivated by the vibrant displays of fruit and the lively banter of the merchants.  He quickly learned the art of haggling, his sharp tongue and quick wit earning him a reputation as a shrewd negotiator.    <br />[25 Jul 1859 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 16 years old, he had his first taste of true success.  He managed to secure a rare and valuable shipment of peaches, which he sold for a handsome profit.  The thrill of the deal, the feeling of power he wielded over the marketplace, fueled his ambition.  <br />[25 Jul 1862 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 19 years old, he purchased his own cart and set out on his own as a travelling merchant.  He traveled from town to town, buying and selling fruit, his booming voice echoing through the streets.  He thrived on the challenge, the constant hustle, the opportunity to make his mark on the world.  <br />[25 Jul 1864 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 21 years old, he encountered a group of bandits who attempted to steal his wares.  Aiden, enraged, fought back with a ferocity that surprised even himself.  He managed to drive off the bandits, but the experience left him shaken, realizing that his temper could be both a blessing and a curse.  <br />[25 Jul 1866 00:00:00]   When Aiden Riversong was 23 years old, he stumbled upon a young boy begging in the streets.  Touched by the boy&#x27;s plight, Aiden took him under his wing, providing him with food, shelter, and a sense of purpose.

She carefully plucked it, savoring its sweetness and imagining herself as a queen ruling over a kingdom of delicious fruit.  When her mother scolded her for not sharing, Hazel quickly pointed out the tiny bruise on the plum, suggesting it wasn&#x27;t as good as the others.   <br />[02 Jul 1855 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 9 years old, she witnessed a gruff farmer haggling fiercely with a traveling merchant over the price of apples.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

She carefully plucked it, savoring its sweetness and imagining herself as a queen ruling over a kingdom of delicious fruit.  When her mother scolded her for not sharing, Hazel quickly pointed out the tiny bruise on the plum, suggesting it wasn&#x27;t as good as the others.   <br />[02 Jul 1858 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 13 years old, she was tasked with selling her family&#x27;s excess produce at the village market.  Nervous and unsure, Hazel stumbled over her words, failing to attract any customers.  To her relief, a kindly old woman approached, praising Hazel&#x27;s beautiful smile and suggesting she focus on the vibrant colors and sweetness of the fruit rather than its price.  <br />[02 Jul 1863 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 19 years old, she saved enough money to purchase a small cart and a few sacks of apples.  Embracing the freedom of the open road, she set off on her first journey as a traveling merchant.  She quickly learned the art of bartering, charming her way into profitable deals and filling her cart with exotic fruits from distant lands.  <br />[02 Jul 1865 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 21 years old, she met a fellow merchant, a gruff but kind man named Silas.  He offered her advice on navigating the treacherous mountain passes and introduced her to new markets.  Though she enjoyed his company, Hazel kept her distance, fearing that genuine connection would expose her vulnerabilities.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Hazel Nutgrove is a travelling merchant.

She carefully plucked it, savoring its sweetness and imagining herself as a queen ruling over a kingdom of delicious fruit.  When her mother scolded her for not sharing, Hazel quickly pointed out the tiny bruise on the plum, suggesting it wasn&#x27;t as good as the others.   <br />[02 Jul 1855 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 9 years old, she witnessed a gruff farmer haggling fiercely with a traveling merchant over the price of apples.

She carefully plucked it, savoring its sweetness and imagining herself as a queen ruling over a kingdom of delicious fruit.  When her mother scolded her for not sharing, Hazel quickly pointed out the tiny bruise on the plum, suggesting it wasn&#x27;t as good as the others.   <br />[02 Jul 1858 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 13 years old, she was tasked with selling her family&#x27;s excess produce at the village market.

She quickly learned the art of bartering, charming her way into profitable deals and filling her cart with exotic fruits from distant lands.  <br />[02 Jul 1865 00:00:00]  When Hazel Nutgrove was 21 years old, she met a fellow merchant, a gruff but kind man named Silas.  He offered her advice on navigating the treacherous mountain passes and introduced her to new markets.  Though she enjoyed his company, Hazel kept her distance, fearing that genuine connection would expose her vulnerabilities.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Aiden Riversong&#x27;s attempted action: 4 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aiden Riversong</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aiden Riversong</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>4 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Aiden Riversong wants to make as much money as possible.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Aiden Riversong is ready to make an offer.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Aiden Riversong are as follows.
