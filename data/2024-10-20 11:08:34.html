You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Magnus Mulberrylane&#x27;s attempted action: Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I can see you&#x27;re a shrewd buyer, Aiden, but I assure you, these apples are of the finest quality and will fetch a handsome price at market.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Magnus Mulberrylane</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Magnus Mulberrylane</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I can see you&#x27;re a shrewd buyer, Aiden, but I assure you, these apples are of the finest quality and will fetch a handsome price at market.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I can see you&#x27;re a shrewd buyer, Aiden, but I assure you, these apples are of the finest quality and will fetch a handsome price at market.</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Magnus Mulberrylane are as follows.

Magnus watched as their parents struggled to come to terms with the loss, but they were determined to help and spent hours helping to clear the debris and replant the fields. This experience instilled in Magnus a sense of resilience and a strong work ethic that would stay with them for the rest of their life.  <br />[16 Sep 1871 00:00:00]    When Magnus Mulberrylane was 9 years old, they began to accompany their father to the local market, where they would watch in awe as the merchants haggled over the prices of their produce. Magnus was fascinated by the way the merchants could turn a simple transaction into an art form, and they spent hours listening to their father&#x27;s stories about the different fruits and vegetables on display. As they sat amidst the vibrant stalls, Magnus felt a sense of wonder and nostalgia that would stay with them for years to come.  <br />[16 Sep 1875 00:00:00]    When Magnus Mulberrylane was 13 years old, they received a harsh lesson in the realities of life when they were caught stealing a few apples from a neighbor&#x27;s orchard. Their parents were disappointed, but instead of punishing them, they sat down with Magnus and explained the value of hard work and the importance of earning a living honestly. This experience taught Magnus the value of integrity and the importance of earning a fair wage for their labor.  <br />[16 Sep 1878 00:00:00]    When Magnus Mulberrylane was 16 years old, they began to take on more responsibilities on the farm, helping to tend to the crops and care for the animals. As they grew older, Magnus developed a keen eye for quality and a passion for finding the rarest and most sought-after fruits in the surrounding countryside. This experience laid the foundation for their future career as a travelling merchant.  <br />[16 Sep 1881 00:00:00]    When Magnus Mulberrylane was 19 years old, they set out on their first solo journey, travelling to the nearby town of Willowdale to purchase a shipment of fresh berries. As they navigated the unfamiliar streets and markets, Magnus felt a sense of excitement and trepidation, but they were determined to succeed and prove themselves as a capable merchant. Despite the challenges they faced, Magnus was able to secure a good deal and return home with a sense of pride and accomplishment.  <br />[16 Sep 1883 00:00:00]    When Magnus Mulberrylane was 21 years old, they met their business partner, Ezra, who became a mentor and a close friend. Ezra taught Magnus the art of negotiation and the importance of building strong relationships with their customers, and together they built a thriving business that would last for years to come. Magnus valued Ezra&#x27;s wisdom and guidance, and they continued to learn from him long after they had established their own reputation as a successful merchant.  <br />[16 Sep 1885 00:00:00]    When Magnus Mulberrylane was 23 years old, they faced their greatest challenge as a merchant when a rival trader attempted to sabotage their business by spreading false rumors about the quality of their fruit.

Magnus watched as their parents struggled to come to terms with the loss, but they were determined to help and spent hours helping to clear the debris and replant the fields. This experience instilled in Magnus a sense of resilience and a strong work ethic that would stay with them for the rest of their life.  <br />[16 Sep 1871 00:00:00]    When Magnus Mulberrylane was 9 years old, they began to accompany their father to the local market, where they would watch in awe as the merchants haggled over the prices of their produce. Magnus was fascinated by the way the merchants could turn a simple transaction into an art form, and they spent hours listening to their father&#x27;s stories about the different fruits and vegetables on display. As they sat amidst the vibrant stalls, Magnus felt a sense of wonder and nostalgia that would stay with them for years to come.  <br />[16 Sep 1875 00:00:00]    When Magnus Mulberrylane was 13 years old, they received a harsh lesson in the realities of life when they were caught stealing a few apples from a neighbor&#x27;s orchard. Their parents were disappointed, but instead of punishing them, they sat down with Magnus and explained the value of hard work and the importance of earning a living honestly. This experience taught Magnus the value of integrity and the importance of earning a fair wage for their labor.  <br />[16 Sep 1878 00:00:00]    When Magnus Mulberrylane was 16 years old, they began to take on more responsibilities on the farm, helping to tend to the crops and care for the animals. As they grew older, Magnus developed a keen eye for quality and a passion for finding the rarest and most sought-after fruits in the surrounding countryside. This experience laid the foundation for their future career as a travelling merchant.  <br />[16 Sep 1881 00:00:00]    When Magnus Mulberrylane was 19 years old, they set out on their first solo journey, travelling to the nearby town of Willowdale to purchase a shipment of fresh berries. As they navigated the unfamiliar streets and markets, Magnus felt a sense of excitement and trepidation, but they were determined to succeed and prove themselves as a capable merchant. Despite the challenges they faced, Magnus was able to secure a good deal and return home with a sense of pride and accomplishment.  <br />[16 Sep 1883 00:00:00]    When Magnus Mulberrylane was 21 years old, they met their business partner, Ezra, who became a mentor and a close friend. Ezra taught Magnus the art of negotiation and the importance of building strong relationships with their customers, and together they built a thriving business that would last for years to come. Magnus valued Ezra&#x27;s wisdom and guidance, and they continued to learn from him long after they had established their own reputation as a successful merchant.  <br />[16 Sep 1885 00:00:00]    When Magnus Mulberrylane was 23 years old, they faced their greatest challenge as a merchant when a rival trader attempted to sabotage their business by spreading false rumors about the quality of their fruit.

Hazel&#x27;s mother would explain to her the importance of treating people with respect and kindness, and Hazel would listen intently, soaking up every word like a sponge.

Hazel&#x27;s mother would explain to her the importance of treating people with respect and kindness, and Hazel would listen intently, soaking up every word like a sponge. As they walked home, Hazel&#x27;s mother would give her a small portion of the day&#x27;s earnings, and Hazel would proudly count out her coins, already developing a sense of responsibility and a love for the world of commerce.  <br />[02 Jul 1851 00:00:00]    When Hazel Nutgrove was 9 years old, she helped her mother deliver a basket of fresh fruit to the local orphanage, where she met a young girl named Emily who had lost her family in a tragic accident. Hazel was deeply moved by Emily&#x27;s story and spent hours listening to her, offering words of comfort and support. From that day on, Hazel made it a point to visit Emily regularly, and the two became close friends, with Hazel learning the value of empathy and compassion in the face of adversity.  <br />[02 Jul 1855 00:00:00]    When Hazel Nutgrove was 13 years old, she began to help her mother with the family&#x27;s fruit business, learning the intricacies of buying and selling produce from the local farmers. She quickly discovered a talent for negotiating prices and selecting the freshest fruits, and her mother began to rely on her more and more as the business grew. Hazel took pride in being able to contribute to the family&#x27;s income and felt a sense of purpose in helping to provide for her family.  <br />[02 Jul 1858 00:00:00]    When Hazel Nutgrove was 16 years old, she had her first major disagreement with a fruit vendor who she felt was taking advantage of her mother&#x27;s kindness. Hazel stood up for her mother, refusing to back down, and eventually the vendor relented, impressed by Hazel&#x27;s determination and conviction. This experience taught Hazel the importance of standing up for what she believed in and asserting herself in difficult situations.  <br />[02 Jul 1861 00:00:00]    When Hazel Nutgrove was 19 years old, she set out on her first solo trip as a merchant, traveling to a nearby town to buy a shipment of exotic fruits. She was nervous but determined, and her hard work paid off as she successfully negotiated a fair price and returned home with a bounty of fresh produce. This experience gave Hazel the confidence to take on more responsibility and expand the family business.  <br />[02 Jul 1863 00:00:00]    When Hazel Nutgrove was 21 years old, she met a young farmer named Thomas who was struggling to make a living due to a severe drought. Hazel worked with Thomas to find alternative sources of water and helped him develop a new crop of drought-resistant fruits, which eventually became a huge success. This experience deepened Hazel&#x27;s connection to the land and the people who worked it, and she continued to support Thomas and his family for years to come.  <br />[02 Jul 1865 00:00:00]    When Hazel Nutgrove was 23 years old, she faced a major setback when a rival merchant tried to sabotage her business by spreading false rumors about the quality of her fruits. Hazel refused to give up, using her quick thinking and resourcefulness to turn the situation around and even attract new customers who were drawn to her integrity and honesty. This experience taught Hazel the importance of staying true to herself and her values, even in the face of adversity.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Hazel was deeply moved by Emily&#x27;s story and spent hours listening to her, offering words of comfort and support. From that day on, Hazel made it a point to visit Emily regularly, and the two became close friends, with Hazel learning the value of empathy and compassion in the face of adversity.  <br />[02 Jul 1855 00:00:00]    When Hazel Nutgrove was 13 years old, she began to help her mother with the family&#x27;s fruit business, learning the intricacies of buying and selling produce from the local farmers. She quickly discovered a talent for negotiating prices and selecting the freshest fruits, and her mother began to rely on her more and more as the business grew. Hazel took pride in being able to contribute to the family&#x27;s income and felt a sense of purpose in helping to provide for her family.  <br />[02 Jul 1858 00:00:00]    When Hazel Nutgrove was 16 years old, she had her first major disagreement with a fruit vendor who she felt was taking advantage of her mother&#x27;s kindness. Hazel stood up for her mother, refusing to back down, and eventually the vendor relented, impressed by Hazel&#x27;s determination and conviction. This experience taught Hazel the importance of standing up for what she believed in and asserting herself in difficult situations.  <br />[02 Jul 1861 00:00:00]    When Hazel Nutgrove was 19 years old, she set out on her first solo trip as a merchant, traveling to a nearby town to buy a shipment of exotic fruits. She was nervous but determined, and her hard work paid off as she successfully negotiated a fair price and returned home with a bounty of fresh produce. This experience gave Hazel the confidence to take on more responsibility and expand the family business.  <br />[02 Jul 1863 00:00:00]    When Hazel Nutgrove was 21 years old, she met a young farmer named Thomas who was struggling to make a living due to a severe drought. Hazel worked with Thomas to find alternative sources of water and helped him develop a new crop of drought-resistant fruits, which eventually became a huge success. This experience deepened Hazel&#x27;s connection to the land and the people who worked it, and she continued to support Thomas and his family for years to come.  <br />[02 Jul 1865 00:00:00]    When Hazel Nutgrove was 23 years old, she faced a major setback when a rival merchant tried to sabotage her business by spreading false rumors about the quality of her fruits. Hazel refused to give up, using her quick thinking and resourcefulness to turn the situation around and even attract new customers who were drawn to her integrity and honesty. This experience taught Hazel the importance of staying true to herself and her values, even in the face of adversity.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I can see you&#x27;re a shrewd buyer, Aiden, but I assure you, these apples are of the finest quality and will fetch a handsome price at market.<br />Aiden Riversong -- &quot;I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m willing to pay that much for these apples, Magnus, considering the prices I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere in the market.<br />Aiden Riversong -- &quot;What makes you think your fruit is worth more than the apples I bought from Magnus just now?<br />Hazel Nutgrove -- &quot;I can see you&#x27;ve done your research, Aiden, but let me tell you, these are no ordinary apples; they&#x27;re from the sweetest trees on the farm, and they&#x27;ll fetch a higher price in the city.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;Hazel, I can see you have some of the finest fruits in the market, but I&#x27;ve been to other vendors already, and I must say, I&#x27;m not willing to pay more than 2 coins for this lot, considering the prices I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere.<br />Hazel Nutgrove -- &quot;I understand you&#x27;ve done your research, Magnus, but let me tell you, these are no ordinary fruits; they&#x27;re from the sweetest trees on the farm, and they&#x27;ll bring a higher price in the city, not to mention the freshness and quality that&#x27;s unmatched elsewhere.<br />Aiden Riversong -- &quot;I was thinking of offering 4 coins for the fruit, is that something you&#x27;d be willing to consider, Mr. Mulberrylane?<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;Four coins is a fair offer, Aiden, but I&#x27;m afraid I can do better than that, considering the quality of these apples and the current market prices.<br /><br /><br />Hazel Nutgrove&#x27;s attempted action: Hazel Nutgrove -- &quot;I understand you&#x27;ve done your research, Aiden, but let me tell you, these are no ordinary fruits, and considering the quality and freshness I&#x27;m offering, I&#x27;m afraid 2 coins is still a bit below what I&#x27;m willing to accept.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Hazel Nutgrove</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Hazel Nutgrove</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Hazel Nutgrove -- &quot;I understand you&#x27;ve done your research, Aiden, but let me tell you, these are no ordinary fruits, and considering the quality and freshness I&#x27;m offering, I&#x27;m afraid 2 coins is still a bit below what I&#x27;m willing to accept.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Hazel Nutgrove -- &quot;I understand you&#x27;ve done your research, Aiden, but let me tell you, these are no ordinary fruits, and considering the quality and freshness I&#x27;m offering, I&#x27;m afraid 2 coins is still a bit below what I&#x27;m willing to accept.</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Hazel Nutgrove are as follows.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

Hazel&#x27;s mother would explain to her the importance of treating people with respect and kindness, and Hazel would listen intently, soaking up every word like a sponge.

Hazel&#x27;s mother would explain to her the importance of treating people with respect and kindness, and Hazel would listen intently, soaking up every word like a sponge. As they walked home, Hazel&#x27;s mother would give her a small portion of the day&#x27;s earnings, and Hazel would proudly count out her coins, already developing a sense of responsibility and a love for the world of commerce.  <br />[02 Jul 1851 00:00:00]    When Hazel Nutgrove was 9 years old, she helped her mother deliver a basket of fresh fruit to the local orphanage, where she met a young girl named Emily who had lost her family in a tragic accident. Hazel was deeply moved by Emily&#x27;s story and spent hours listening to her, offering words of comfort and support. From that day on, Hazel made it a point to visit Emily regularly, and the two became close friends, with Hazel learning the value of empathy and compassion in the face of adversity.  <br />[02 Jul 1855 00:00:00]    When Hazel Nutgrove was 13 years old, she began to help her mother with the family&#x27;s fruit business, learning the intricacies of buying and selling produce from the local farmers. She quickly discovered a talent for negotiating prices and selecting the freshest fruits, and her mother began to rely on her more and more as the business grew. Hazel took pride in being able to contribute to the family&#x27;s income and felt a sense of purpose in helping to provide for her family.  <br />[02 Jul 1858 00:00:00]    When Hazel Nutgrove was 16 years old, she had her first major disagreement with a fruit vendor who she felt was taking advantage of her mother&#x27;s kindness. Hazel stood up for her mother, refusing to back down, and eventually the vendor relented, impressed by Hazel&#x27;s determination and conviction. This experience taught Hazel the importance of standing up for what she believed in and asserting herself in difficult situations.  <br />[02 Jul 1861 00:00:00]    When Hazel Nutgrove was 19 years old, she set out on her first solo trip as a merchant, traveling to a nearby town to buy a shipment of exotic fruits. She was nervous but determined, and her hard work paid off as she successfully negotiated a fair price and returned home with a bounty of fresh produce. This experience gave Hazel the confidence to take on more responsibility and expand the family business.  <br />[02 Jul 1863 00:00:00]    When Hazel Nutgrove was 21 years old, she met a young farmer named Thomas who was struggling to make a living due to a severe drought. Hazel worked with Thomas to find alternative sources of water and helped him develop a new crop of drought-resistant fruits, which eventually became a huge success. This experience deepened Hazel&#x27;s connection to the land and the people who worked it, and she continued to support Thomas and his family for years to come.  <br />[02 Jul 1865 00:00:00]    When Hazel Nutgrove was 23 years old, she faced a major setback when a rival merchant tried to sabotage her business by spreading false rumors about the quality of her fruits. Hazel refused to give up, using her quick thinking and resourcefulness to turn the situation around and even attract new customers who were drawn to her integrity and honesty. This experience taught Hazel the importance of staying true to herself and her values, even in the face of adversity.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I can see you&#x27;re a shrewd buyer, Aiden, but I assure you, these apples are of the finest quality and will fetch a handsome price at market.<br />Aiden Riversong -- &quot;I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m willing to pay that much for these apples, Magnus, considering the prices I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere in the market.<br />Aiden Riversong -- &quot;What makes you think your fruit is worth more than the apples I bought from Magnus just now?<br />Hazel Nutgrove -- &quot;I can see you&#x27;ve done your research, Aiden, but let me tell you, these are no ordinary apples; they&#x27;re from the sweetest trees on the farm, and they&#x27;ll fetch a higher price in the city.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;Hazel, I can see you have some of the finest fruits in the market, but I&#x27;ve been to other vendors already, and I must say, I&#x27;m not willing to pay more than 2 coins for this lot, considering the prices I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere.<br />Hazel Nutgrove -- &quot;I understand you&#x27;ve done your research, Magnus, but let me tell you, these are no ordinary fruits; they&#x27;re from the sweetest trees on the farm, and they&#x27;ll bring a higher price in the city, not to mention the freshness and quality that&#x27;s unmatched elsewhere.<br />Aiden Riversong -- &quot;I was thinking of offering 4 coins for the fruit, is that something you&#x27;d be willing to consider, Mr. Mulberrylane?<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;Four coins is a fair offer, Aiden, but I&#x27;m afraid I can do better than that, considering the quality of these apples and the current market prices.<br />Hazel Nutgrove -- &quot;I understand you&#x27;ve done your research, Aiden, but let me tell you, these are no ordinary fruits, and considering the quality and freshness I&#x27;m offering, I&#x27;m afraid 2 coins is still a bit below what I&#x27;m willing to accept.<br />Aiden Riversong -- &quot;I see, and I appreciate your confidence in the quality of your fruits, but I&#x27;m afraid 2 coins is still a bit higher than I&#x27;m willing to pay, considering the price I can get for them back in town.<br />Hazel Nutgrove -- &quot;I understand that you&#x27;ve seen other vendors, Magnus, but I assure you, my fruits are of the highest quality, and I&#x27;m willing to meet you halfway at 2.25 coins, but I&#x27;m afraid that&#x27;s as low as I can go.<br /><br /><br />Magnus Mulberrylane&#x27;s attempted action: Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I appreciate your offer, Hazel, but I&#x27;m afraid I can do better than that; I&#x27;ve seen some of these fruits for as low as 2 coins at the Greenleaf Market, and I&#x27;m not willing to pay more than that.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Magnus Mulberrylane</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Magnus Mulberrylane</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I appreciate your offer, Hazel, but I&#x27;m afraid I can do better than that; I&#x27;ve seen some of these fruits for as low as 2 coins at the Greenleaf Market, and I&#x27;m not willing to pay more than that.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I appreciate your offer, Hazel, but I&#x27;m afraid I can do better than that; I&#x27;ve seen some of these fruits for as low as 2 coins at the Greenleaf Market, and I&#x27;m not willing to pay more than that.</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Magnus Mulberrylane are as follows.

Magnus watched as their parents struggled to come to terms with the loss, but they were determined to help and spent hours helping to clear the debris and replant the fields. This experience instilled in Magnus a sense of resilience and a strong work ethic that would stay with them for the rest of their life.  <br />[16 Sep 1871 00:00:00]    When Magnus Mulberrylane was 9 years old, they began to accompany their father to the local market, where they would watch in awe as the merchants haggled over the prices of their produce. Magnus was fascinated by the way the merchants could turn a simple transaction into an art form, and they spent hours listening to their father&#x27;s stories about the different fruits and vegetables on display. As they sat amidst the vibrant stalls, Magnus felt a sense of wonder and nostalgia that would stay with them for years to come.  <br />[16 Sep 1875 00:00:00]    When Magnus Mulberrylane was 13 years old, they received a harsh lesson in the realities of life when they were caught stealing a few apples from a neighbor&#x27;s orchard. Their parents were disappointed, but instead of punishing them, they sat down with Magnus and explained the value of hard work and the importance of earning a living honestly. This experience taught Magnus the value of integrity and the importance of earning a fair wage for their labor.  <br />[16 Sep 1878 00:00:00]    When Magnus Mulberrylane was 16 years old, they began to take on more responsibilities on the farm, helping to tend to the crops and care for the animals. As they grew older, Magnus developed a keen eye for quality and a passion for finding the rarest and most sought-after fruits in the surrounding countryside. This experience laid the foundation for their future career as a travelling merchant.  <br />[16 Sep 1881 00:00:00]    When Magnus Mulberrylane was 19 years old, they set out on their first solo journey, travelling to the nearby town of Willowdale to purchase a shipment of fresh berries. As they navigated the unfamiliar streets and markets, Magnus felt a sense of excitement and trepidation, but they were determined to succeed and prove themselves as a capable merchant. Despite the challenges they faced, Magnus was able to secure a good deal and return home with a sense of pride and accomplishment.  <br />[16 Sep 1883 00:00:00]    When Magnus Mulberrylane was 21 years old, they met their business partner, Ezra, who became a mentor and a close friend. Ezra taught Magnus the art of negotiation and the importance of building strong relationships with their customers, and together they built a thriving business that would last for years to come.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
