To run a full simulation, you would need to:

1. Set up a proper language model (GPT, Claude, etc.)
2. Use Concordia's simulation environment to run rounds
3. Each round, agents would:
   - Observe the current situation
   - Use their negotiation strategy to decide action
   - Make offers, counteroffers, or accept/reject
   - Game master tracks state and enforces rules

The negotiation would continue until:
- Agreement reached (both accept an offer)
- Maximum rounds exceeded  
- One party walks away
