It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Those apples look fine, but I&#x27;m afraid your price is a bit steep.

She noticed the subtle shifts in his expression, the way he held his hands, and the quiet strength in his voice.  Della vowed to learn the art of the bargain, to master the language of persuasion.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, a traveling storyteller captivated the village with tales of faraway lands and exotic fruits.  Della’s imagination soared as she listened, yearning for a world beyond the dusty roads and familiar fields.  She began to collect seeds from every fruit she encountered, dreaming of planting her own orchard one day.   <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father fell ill, leaving Della to manage the fruit cart alone.  She felt a surge of fear and responsibility, but also a flicker of excitement.  She navigated the bustling marketplace with newfound confidence, her father&#x27;s lessons echoing in her ears.  Della learned that day that she was stronger than she thought.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she encountered a sly merchant who tried to cheat her out of a valuable pear.  Della, using her sharp wit and keen observation, exposed his trickery, leaving him humiliated and empty-handed.  The victory tasted sweet, but it left a bitter aftertaste, a reminder of the dishonesty that lurked beneath the surface of the world.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she met a young man with kind eyes and a gentle smile.  They shared a love for fruit, exchanging stories and laughter as they strolled through the marketplace.  Della felt a warmth blossom in her chest, a longing for connection she had never experienced before.  But she pulled back, afraid to let anyone see the vulnerability beneath her carefully constructed facade.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she expanded her business, traveling to distant villages and trading for rare and exotic fruits.  She built a reputation for her discerning eye and her fair dealings, her cart becoming a symbol of quality and trust.  Yet, with each success, the emptiness within her grew, a reminder that material wealth could not fill the void in her heart.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she stumbled upon a hidden grove of ancient apple trees, their branches laden with fruit unlike any she had ever seen.  The apples were a symphony of colors and flavors, each bite a revelation.  Della felt a sense of wonder and awe, a connection to something larger than herself.  She knew in that moment that her journey was far from over, that there were still secrets waiting to be discovered, both within herself and in the world around her.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon watched, mesmerized, as his father skillfully negotiated a lower price, his sharp tongue and cunning mind proving victorious.  He saw the pride in his father&#x27;s eyes and felt a spark of ambition ignite within him; he wanted to be just as shrewd, just as successful.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he helped his father sell fruit at the local market. He saw firsthand the power of a good deal, the satisfaction of outsmarting a customer, and the joy of accumulating wealth. He began to see fruit not just as food, but as a means to an end, a tool for achieving his own ambitions.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him travel to the neighboring town to sell fruit on his own. He spent weeks planning his route, meticulously researching the best prices to offer and the most profitable goods to carry.  He was determined to prove his worth, to show his father that he was capable of handling his own business.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a dishonest merchant who tried to cheat him out of a fair price for a load of apples. Lennon, fueled by his innate sense of injustice, stood his ground, refusing to be taken advantage of. He argued fiercely, his voice rising in indignation, until the merchant finally relented, conceding a fair price. This victory, though small, solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief in his own shrewdness and his determination to never be outwitted again.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He saw firsthand the power of a good deal, the satisfaction of outsmarting a customer, and the joy of accumulating wealth. He began to see fruit not just as food, but as a means to an end, a tool for achieving his own ambitions.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him travel to the neighboring town to sell fruit on his own. He spent weeks planning his route, meticulously researching the best prices to offer and the most profitable goods to carry.  He was determined to prove his worth, to show his father that he was capable of handling his own business.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a dishonest merchant who tried to cheat him out of a fair price for a load of apples. Lennon, fueled by his innate sense of injustice, stood his ground, refusing to be taken advantage of. He argued fiercely, his voice rising in indignation, until the merchant finally relented, conceding a fair price. This victory, though small, solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief in his own shrewdness and his determination to never be outwitted again.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, wide-eyed, noticed how his father&#x27;s tone changed depending on the farmer&#x27;s mood, becoming more playful when the farmer laughed and more serious when he frowned.  That day, Cedric decided he wanted to be a master of words, a weaver of deals.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his mother gather fruit for market.  As he carefully sorted the apples, he noticed a small, bruised one hidden amongst the rest. Cedric, wanting to avoid disappointing his mother, quickly hid the apple in his pocket, vowing to sell it himself later for a good price.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Della’s imagination soared as she listened, yearning for a world beyond the dusty roads and familiar fields.  She began to collect seeds from every fruit she encountered, dreaming of planting her own orchard one day.   <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father fell ill, leaving Della to manage the fruit cart alone.  She felt a surge of fear and responsibility, but also a flicker of excitement.  She navigated the bustling marketplace with newfound confidence, her father&#x27;s lessons echoing in her ears.  Della learned that day that she was stronger than she thought.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she encountered a sly merchant who tried to cheat her out of a valuable pear.  Della, using her sharp wit and keen observation, exposed his trickery, leaving him humiliated and empty-handed.

She built a reputation for her discerning eye and her fair dealings, her cart becoming a symbol of quality and trust.  Yet, with each success, the emptiness within her grew, a reminder that material wealth could not fill the void in her heart.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she stumbled upon a hidden grove of ancient apple trees, their branches laden with fruit unlike any she had ever seen.  The apples were a symphony of colors and flavors, each bite a revelation.  Della felt a sense of wonder and awe, a connection to something larger than herself.

Cedric, wide-eyed, noticed how his father&#x27;s tone changed depending on the farmer&#x27;s mood, becoming more playful when the farmer laughed and more serious when he frowned.  That day, Cedric decided he wanted to be a master of words, a weaver of deals.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his mother gather fruit for market.  As he carefully sorted the apples, he noticed a small, bruised one hidden amongst the rest. Cedric, wanting to avoid disappointing his mother, quickly hid the apple in his pocket, vowing to sell it himself later for a good price.  This act of deception, small as it was, planted a seed of self-preservation within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his parents to let him travel to the neighboring village to sell his own basket of plums.  He practiced his sales pitch in front of the mirror, changing his voice and gestures to appeal to different types of customers.  He returned home with a few coins earned and a head full of excitement, realizing the thrill of independence and the power of persuasion.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Della Plumstone -- &quot;Those apples look fine, but I&#x27;m afraid your price is a bit steep.

She built a reputation for her discerning eye and her fair dealings, her cart becoming a symbol of quality and trust.  Yet, with each success, the emptiness within her grew, a reminder that material wealth could not fill the void in her heart.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she stumbled upon a hidden grove of ancient apple trees, their branches laden with fruit unlike any she had ever seen.  The apples were a symphony of colors and flavors, each bite a revelation.  Della felt a sense of wonder and awe, a connection to something larger than herself.  She knew in that moment that her journey was far from over, that there were still secrets waiting to be discovered, both within herself and in the world around her.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He saw firsthand the power of a good deal, the satisfaction of outsmarting a customer, and the joy of accumulating wealth. He began to see fruit not just as food, but as a means to an end, a tool for achieving his own ambitions.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him travel to the neighboring town to sell fruit on his own. He spent weeks planning his route, meticulously researching the best prices to offer and the most profitable goods to carry.  He was determined to prove his worth, to show his father that he was capable of handling his own business.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a dishonest merchant who tried to cheat him out of a fair price for a load of apples. Lennon, fueled by his innate sense of injustice, stood his ground, refusing to be taken advantage of. He argued fiercely, his voice rising in indignation, until the merchant finally relented, conceding a fair price. This victory, though small, solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief in his own shrewdness and his determination to never be outwitted again.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

She noticed the subtle shifts in his expression, the way he held his hands, and the quiet strength in his voice.  Della vowed to learn the art of the bargain, to master the language of persuasion.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, a traveling storyteller captivated the village with tales of faraway lands and exotic fruits.  Della’s imagination soared as she listened, yearning for a world beyond the dusty roads and familiar fields.  She began to collect seeds from every fruit she encountered, dreaming of planting her own orchard one day.   <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father fell ill, leaving Della to manage the fruit cart alone.  She felt a surge of fear and responsibility, but also a flicker of excitement.  She navigated the bustling marketplace with newfound confidence, her father&#x27;s lessons echoing in her ears.  Della learned that day that she was stronger than she thought.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she encountered a sly merchant who tried to cheat her out of a valuable pear.  Della, using her sharp wit and keen observation, exposed his trickery, leaving him humiliated and empty-handed.  The victory tasted sweet, but it left a bitter aftertaste, a reminder of the dishonesty that lurked beneath the surface of the world.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she met a young man with kind eyes and a gentle smile.

Lennon watched, mesmerized, as his father skillfully negotiated a lower price, his sharp tongue and cunning mind proving victorious.  He saw the pride in his father&#x27;s eyes and felt a spark of ambition ignite within him; he wanted to be just as shrewd, just as successful.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he helped his father sell fruit at the local market. He saw firsthand the power of a good deal, the satisfaction of outsmarting a customer, and the joy of accumulating wealth. He began to see fruit not just as food, but as a means to an end, a tool for achieving his own ambitions.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him travel to the neighboring town to sell fruit on his own. He spent weeks planning his route, meticulously researching the best prices to offer and the most profitable goods to carry.  He was determined to prove his worth, to show his father that he was capable of handling his own business.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a dishonest merchant who tried to cheat him out of a fair price for a load of apples. Lennon, fueled by his innate sense of injustice, stood his ground, refusing to be taken advantage of. He argued fiercely, his voice rising in indignation, until the merchant finally relented, conceding a fair price. This victory, though small, solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief in his own shrewdness and his determination to never be outwitted again.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, wide-eyed, noticed how his father&#x27;s tone changed depending on the farmer&#x27;s mood, becoming more playful when the farmer laughed and more serious when he frowned.  That day, Cedric decided he wanted to be a master of words, a weaver of deals.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his mother gather fruit for market.  As he carefully sorted the apples, he noticed a small, bruised one hidden amongst the rest. Cedric, wanting to avoid disappointing his mother, quickly hid the apple in his pocket, vowing to sell it himself later for a good price.  This act of deception, small as it was, planted a seed of self-preservation within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his parents to let him travel to the neighboring village to sell his own basket of plums.  He practiced his sales pitch in front of the mirror, changing his voice and gestures to appeal to different types of customers.  He returned home with a few coins earned and a head full of excitement, realizing the thrill of independence and the power of persuasion.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he met a kind old woman who took him in and taught him the art of fruit grafting.  He learned about the delicate balance of nature, the importance of patience and care, and the beauty of creating something new.  This experience opened his heart to the possibility of connection and belonging, a longing that would continue to drive him throughout his life.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Della’s imagination soared as she listened, yearning for a world beyond the dusty roads and familiar fields.  She began to collect seeds from every fruit she encountered, dreaming of planting her own orchard one day.   <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father fell ill, leaving Della to manage the fruit cart alone.  She felt a surge of fear and responsibility, but also a flicker of excitement.  She navigated the bustling marketplace with newfound confidence, her father&#x27;s lessons echoing in her ears.  Della learned that day that she was stronger than she thought.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she encountered a sly merchant who tried to cheat her out of a valuable pear.  Della, using her sharp wit and keen observation, exposed his trickery, leaving him humiliated and empty-handed.  The victory tasted sweet, but it left a bitter aftertaste, a reminder of the dishonesty that lurked beneath the surface of the world.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she met a young man with kind eyes and a gentle smile.  They shared a love for fruit, exchanging stories and laughter as they strolled through the marketplace.  Della felt a warmth blossom in her chest, a longing for connection she had never experienced before.  But she pulled back, afraid to let anyone see the vulnerability beneath her carefully constructed facade.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she expanded her business, traveling to distant villages and trading for rare and exotic fruits.  She built a reputation for her discerning eye and her fair dealings, her cart becoming a symbol of quality and trust.  Yet, with each success, the emptiness within her grew, a reminder that material wealth could not fill the void in her heart.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she stumbled upon a hidden grove of ancient apple trees, their branches laden with fruit unlike any she had ever seen.  The apples were a symphony of colors and flavors, each bite a revelation.  Della felt a sense of wonder and awe, a connection to something larger than herself.  She knew in that moment that her journey was far from over, that there were still secrets waiting to be discovered, both within herself and in the world around her.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, wide-eyed, noticed how his father&#x27;s tone changed depending on the farmer&#x27;s mood, becoming more playful when the farmer laughed and more serious when he frowned.  That day, Cedric decided he wanted to be a master of words, a weaver of deals.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his mother gather fruit for market.  As he carefully sorted the apples, he noticed a small, bruised one hidden amongst the rest. Cedric, wanting to avoid disappointing his mother, quickly hid the apple in his pocket, vowing to sell it himself later for a good price.  This act of deception, small as it was, planted a seed of self-preservation within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his parents to let him travel to the neighboring village to sell his own basket of plums.  He practiced his sales pitch in front of the mirror, changing his voice and gestures to appeal to different types of customers.  He returned home with a few coins earned and a head full of excitement, realizing the thrill of independence and the power of persuasion.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Della Plumstone -- &quot;Those apples look fine, but I&#x27;m afraid your price is a bit steep.

He saw firsthand the power of a good deal, the satisfaction of outsmarting a customer, and the joy of accumulating wealth.

He spent weeks planning his route, meticulously researching the best prices to offer and the most profitable goods to carry.  He was determined to prove his worth, to show his father that he was capable of handling his own business.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a dishonest merchant who tried to cheat him out of a fair price for a load of apples.

He saw firsthand the power of a good deal, the satisfaction of outsmarting a customer, and the joy of accumulating wealth. He began to see fruit not just as food, but as a means to an end, a tool for achieving his own ambitions.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him travel to the neighboring town to sell fruit on his own. He spent weeks planning his route, meticulously researching the best prices to offer and the most profitable goods to carry.  He was determined to prove his worth, to show his father that he was capable of handling his own business.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a dishonest merchant who tried to cheat him out of a fair price for a load of apples. Lennon, fueled by his innate sense of injustice, stood his ground, refusing to be taken advantage of. He argued fiercely, his voice rising in indignation, until the merchant finally relented, conceding a fair price. This victory, though small, solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief in his own shrewdness and his determination to never be outwitted again.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

She noticed the subtle shifts in his expression, the way he held his hands, and the quiet strength in his voice.  Della vowed to learn the art of the bargain, to master the language of persuasion.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, a traveling storyteller captivated the village with tales of faraway lands and exotic fruits.  Della’s imagination soared as she listened, yearning for a world beyond the dusty roads and familiar fields.  She began to collect seeds from every fruit she encountered, dreaming of planting her own orchard one day.   <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father fell ill, leaving Della to manage the fruit cart alone.  She felt a surge of fear and responsibility, but also a flicker of excitement.  She navigated the bustling marketplace with newfound confidence, her father&#x27;s lessons echoing in her ears.  Della learned that day that she was stronger than she thought.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she encountered a sly merchant who tried to cheat her out of a valuable pear.  Della, using her sharp wit and keen observation, exposed his trickery, leaving him humiliated and empty-handed.  The victory tasted sweet, but it left a bitter aftertaste, a reminder of the dishonesty that lurked beneath the surface of the world.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she met a young man with kind eyes and a gentle smile.  They shared a love for fruit, exchanging stories and laughter as they strolled through the marketplace.  Della felt a warmth blossom in her chest, a longing for connection she had never experienced before.  But she pulled back, afraid to let anyone see the vulnerability beneath her carefully constructed facade.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she expanded her business, traveling to distant villages and trading for rare and exotic fruits.  She built a reputation for her discerning eye and her fair dealings, her cart becoming a symbol of quality and trust.  Yet, with each success, the emptiness within her grew, a reminder that material wealth could not fill the void in her heart.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she stumbled upon a hidden grove of ancient apple trees, their branches laden with fruit unlike any she had ever seen.  The apples were a symphony of colors and flavors, each bite a revelation.  Della felt a sense of wonder and awe, a connection to something larger than herself.  She knew in that moment that her journey was far from over, that there were still secrets waiting to be discovered, both within herself and in the world around her.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

As he carefully sorted the apples, he noticed a small, bruised one hidden amongst the rest. Cedric, wanting to avoid disappointing his mother, quickly hid the apple in his pocket, vowing to sell it himself later for a good price.  This act of deception, small as it was, planted a seed of self-preservation within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his parents to let him travel to the neighboring village to sell his own basket of plums.  He practiced his sales pitch in front of the mirror, changing his voice and gestures to appeal to different types of customers.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.
