The bustling crowd, the colorful fruits, and the constant chatter overwhelmed her, but she found a strange comfort in the rhythm of the trade.  Weighing apples, sorting oranges, and haggling with customers filled the void left by her father&#x27;s absence.    <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she traveled to a neighboring town for the first time.  She set up her cart in the bustling marketplace, her heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and trepidation.  A gruff old merchant haggled with her over the price of her peaches, but in the end, he bought her entire stock.  The warmth of the sun on her face, the feel of the coins in her hand, and the satisfaction of a successful transaction filled her with a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a traveling storyteller who regaled her with tales of faraway lands and exotic fruits.  His words ignited a spark of wanderlust within her, and she resolved to explore the world beyond her own village.  She packed her cart with the finest fruits her region had to offer and set off on a journey that would change her life forever.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she stumbled upon a small village ravaged by a recent drought.  The villagers were desperate for food, and Della, moved by their plight, decided to give away her entire stock of fruit.  The villagers, overcome with gratitude, showered her with blessings and offered her shelter for the night.  Della realized that the true joy of her trade lay not in profit, but in sharing the bounty of the earth with those in need.        <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He begged his mother for one, but she refused, saying they were frivolous and useless.  That night, Lennon snuck out and traded a prized toy for a single bead, the first time he felt the thrill of a bargain.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his father at the carpentry shop, but his mind wandered to the bustling marketplace across the street.  He imagined himself not crafting wooden furniture, but selling exotic fruits, surrounded by the sights and smells of faraway lands.  That day, he decided he would become a merchant, a seeker of treasures beyond the confines of his village.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he accompanied his father to barter for supplies.  He saw a merchant cheating a customer, overcharging for a damaged basket.  Lennon, torn between loyalty to his father and his own sense of justice, said nothing, but the incident planted a seed of doubt in his young mind.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started to secretly save money, buying and selling small trinkets at the village market.  He learned the art of negotiation, the subtle dance of persuasion, and the intoxicating feeling of making a profit.  He felt a growing sense of independence, a desire to break free from the expectations of his family.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he saved enough money to buy a small cart.  He packed it with mangoes from his uncle&#x27;s orchard and set off on his first journey, leaving behind the familiarity of his village.  The open road beckoned, promising adventure and a chance to forge his own path.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a severe storm while travelling through the mountains.  He lost most of his fruit, but he managed to salvage a few precious mangoes.  He sold them at a village market, but felt a pang of guilt when he realized he had overcharged the villagers, desperate to recoup his losses.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he met a kind old woman who offered him shelter and food after a particularly harsh day on the road.  He felt a surge of gratitude, realizing that even in his solitary life, he could find kindness and connection.  He promised himself to be more generous, to use his wealth to help others, but the temptation to cheat and deceive still lingered.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He imagined himself not crafting wooden furniture, but selling exotic fruits, surrounded by the sights and smells of faraway lands.  That day, he decided he would become a merchant, a seeker of treasures beyond the confines of his village.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started to secretly save money, buying and selling small trinkets at the village market.

The open road beckoned, promising adventure and a chance to forge his own path.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a severe storm while travelling through the mountains.

The bustling crowd, the colorful fruits, and the constant chatter overwhelmed her, but she found a strange comfort in the rhythm of the trade.

A gruff old merchant haggled with her over the price of her peaches, but in the end, he bought her entire stock.

He begged his mother for one, but she refused, saying they were frivolous and useless.  That night, Lennon snuck out and traded a prized toy for a single bead, the first time he felt the thrill of a bargain.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his father at the carpentry shop, but his mind wandered to the bustling marketplace across the street.  He imagined himself not crafting wooden furniture, but selling exotic fruits, surrounded by the sights and smells of faraway lands.  That day, he decided he would become a merchant, a seeker of treasures beyond the confines of his village.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he accompanied his father to barter for supplies.  He saw a merchant cheating a customer, overcharging for a damaged basket.  Lennon, torn between loyalty to his father and his own sense of justice, said nothing, but the incident planted a seed of doubt in his young mind.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started to secretly save money, buying and selling small trinkets at the village market.  He learned the art of negotiation, the subtle dance of persuasion, and the intoxicating feeling of making a profit.  He felt a growing sense of independence, a desire to break free from the expectations of his family.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he saved enough money to buy a small cart.  He packed it with mangoes from his uncle&#x27;s orchard and set off on his first journey, leaving behind the familiarity of his village.  The open road beckoned, promising adventure and a chance to forge his own path.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a severe storm while travelling through the mountains.  He lost most of his fruit, but he managed to salvage a few precious mangoes.  He sold them at a village market, but felt a pang of guilt when he realized he had overcharged the villagers, desperate to recoup his losses.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he met a kind old woman who offered him shelter and food after a particularly harsh day on the road.  He felt a surge of gratitude, realizing that even in his solitary life, he could find kindness and connection.  He promised himself to be more generous, to use his wealth to help others, but the temptation to cheat and deceive still lingered.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He begged his mother for one, but she refused, saying they were frivolous and useless.  That night, Lennon snuck out and traded a prized toy for a single bead, the first time he felt the thrill of a bargain.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his father at the carpentry shop, but his mind wandered to the bustling marketplace across the street.  He imagined himself not crafting wooden furniture, but selling exotic fruits, surrounded by the sights and smells of faraway lands.  That day, he decided he would become a merchant, a seeker of treasures beyond the confines of his village.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he accompanied his father to barter for supplies.  He saw a merchant cheating a customer, overcharging for a damaged basket.  Lennon, torn between loyalty to his father and his own sense of justice, said nothing, but the incident planted a seed of doubt in his young mind.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started to secretly save money, buying and selling small trinkets at the village market.  He learned the art of negotiation, the subtle dance of persuasion, and the intoxicating feeling of making a profit.  He felt a growing sense of independence, a desire to break free from the expectations of his family.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he saved enough money to buy a small cart.  He packed it with mangoes from his uncle&#x27;s orchard and set off on his first journey, leaving behind the familiarity of his village.  The open road beckoned, promising adventure and a chance to forge his own path.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a severe storm while travelling through the mountains.  He lost most of his fruit, but he managed to salvage a few precious mangoes.  He sold them at a village market, but felt a pang of guilt when he realized he had overcharged the villagers, desperate to recoup his losses.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he met a kind old woman who offered him shelter and food after a particularly harsh day on the road.  He felt a surge of gratitude, realizing that even in his solitary life, he could find kindness and connection.  He promised himself to be more generous, to use his wealth to help others, but the temptation to cheat and deceive still lingered.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He spent hours carefully picking the ripe berries, imagining himself a merchant selling them to the townsfolk for a handsome profit. Cedric knew, even at that young age, that he loved the thrill of bartering and the joy of sharing something special with others.   <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, his father gave him a small wooden cart to pull around the farm. Cedric, ever the innovator, decided to turn it into a miniature marketplace. He gathered up his collection of pebbles, shells, and twigs, carefully arranging them on the cart and haggling with his siblings over their worth. This early experience solidified Cedric&#x27;s love for trading and his ability to see value in seemingly ordinary things.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his father to let him help at the local market. Cedric was mesmerized by the bustling atmosphere, the colorful displays of produce, and the lively negotiations.  He spent the day observing the merchants, absorbing their techniques and learning the art of persuasion. By the end of the day, Cedric had sold a few of his own homemade apple pies, earning his first real profit.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he helped his father harvest a bumper crop of apples.  Seeing so many apples, Cedric envisioned a way to preserve them for longer. He spent weeks researching and experimenting, finally developing a method of drying apples that kept them fresh for months. Cedric&#x27;s innovative approach to preservation impressed local merchants, who began placing orders for his dried apples.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he decided to apprentice himself to a traveling merchant.  He was eager to learn the secrets of the trade and to experience the world beyond his small town.  Cedric quickly proved himself to be a quick learner, his natural charisma and knowledge of fruits making him a valuable asset to the merchant.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he saved enough money to purchase his own wagon. He filled it with a carefully curated selection of fruits from his father&#x27;s orchard and neighboring farms. With a heart full of excitement and a head full of dreams, Cedric set off on his first independent journey.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he encountered a severe storm during his travels. His wagon was damaged, and his precious cargo was threatened.  Cedric, however, refused to give up. He used his ingenuity to repair his wagon and his knowledge of fruits to barter with other travelers for supplies.  This experience taught Cedric the importance of resilience and resourcefulness.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He spent hours carefully picking the ripe berries, imagining himself a merchant selling them to the townsfolk for a handsome profit. Cedric knew, even at that young age, that he loved the thrill of bartering and the joy of sharing something special with others.   <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, his father gave him a small wooden cart to pull around the farm.

This early experience solidified Cedric&#x27;s love for trading and his ability to see value in seemingly ordinary things.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his father to let him help at the local market.

He spent hours carefully picking the ripe berries, imagining himself a merchant selling them to the townsfolk for a handsome profit. Cedric knew, even at that young age, that he loved the thrill of bartering and the joy of sharing something special with others.   <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, his father gave him a small wooden cart to pull around the farm. Cedric, ever the innovator, decided to turn it into a miniature marketplace. He gathered up his collection of pebbles, shells, and twigs, carefully arranging them on the cart and haggling with his siblings over their worth. This early experience solidified Cedric&#x27;s love for trading and his ability to see value in seemingly ordinary things.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his father to let him help at the local market. Cedric was mesmerized by the bustling atmosphere, the colorful displays of produce, and the lively negotiations.  He spent the day observing the merchants, absorbing their techniques and learning the art of persuasion. By the end of the day, Cedric had sold a few of his own homemade apple pies, earning his first real profit.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he helped his father harvest a bumper crop of apples.  Seeing so many apples, Cedric envisioned a way to preserve them for longer. He spent weeks researching and experimenting, finally developing a method of drying apples that kept them fresh for months. Cedric&#x27;s innovative approach to preservation impressed local merchants, who began placing orders for his dried apples.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he decided to apprentice himself to a traveling merchant.  He was eager to learn the secrets of the trade and to experience the world beyond his small town.  Cedric quickly proved himself to be a quick learner, his natural charisma and knowledge of fruits making him a valuable asset to the merchant.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he saved enough money to purchase his own wagon. He filled it with a carefully curated selection of fruits from his father&#x27;s orchard and neighboring farms. With a heart full of excitement and a head full of dreams, Cedric set off on his first independent journey.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he encountered a severe storm during his travels. His wagon was damaged, and his precious cargo was threatened.  Cedric, however, refused to give up. He used his ingenuity to repair his wagon and his knowledge of fruits to barter with other travelers for supplies.  This experience taught Cedric the importance of resilience and resourcefulness.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He spent hours carefully picking the ripe berries, imagining himself a merchant selling them to the townsfolk for a handsome profit. Cedric knew, even at that young age, that he loved the thrill of bartering and the joy of sharing something special with others.   <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, his father gave him a small wooden cart to pull around the farm. Cedric, ever the innovator, decided to turn it into a miniature marketplace. He gathered up his collection of pebbles, shells, and twigs, carefully arranging them on the cart and haggling with his siblings over their worth. This early experience solidified Cedric&#x27;s love for trading and his ability to see value in seemingly ordinary things.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his father to let him help at the local market. Cedric was mesmerized by the bustling atmosphere, the colorful displays of produce, and the lively negotiations.  He spent the day observing the merchants, absorbing their techniques and learning the art of persuasion. By the end of the day, Cedric had sold a few of his own homemade apple pies, earning his first real profit.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he decided to apprentice himself to a traveling merchant.  He was eager to learn the secrets of the trade and to experience the world beyond his small town.  Cedric quickly proved himself to be a quick learner, his natural charisma and knowledge of fruits making him a valuable asset to the merchant.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he saved enough money to purchase his own wagon. He filled it with a carefully curated selection of fruits from his father&#x27;s orchard and neighboring farms. With a heart full of excitement and a head full of dreams, Cedric set off on his first independent journey.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He imagined himself not crafting wooden furniture, but selling exotic fruits, surrounded by the sights and smells of faraway lands.  That day, he decided he would become a merchant, a seeker of treasures beyond the confines of his village.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started to secretly save money, buying and selling small trinkets at the village market.  He learned the art of negotiation, the subtle dance of persuasion, and the intoxicating feeling of making a profit.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He spent hours carefully picking the ripe berries, imagining himself a merchant selling them to the townsfolk for a handsome profit. Cedric knew, even at that young age, that he loved the thrill of bartering and the joy of sharing something special with others.   <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, his father gave him a small wooden cart to pull around the farm. Cedric, ever the innovator, decided to turn it into a miniature marketplace. He gathered up his collection of pebbles, shells, and twigs, carefully arranging them on the cart and haggling with his siblings over their worth. This early experience solidified Cedric&#x27;s love for trading and his ability to see value in seemingly ordinary things.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his father to let him help at the local market. Cedric was mesmerized by the bustling atmosphere, the colorful displays of produce, and the lively negotiations.  He spent the day observing the merchants, absorbing their techniques and learning the art of persuasion. By the end of the day, Cedric had sold a few of his own homemade apple pies, earning his first real profit.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he helped his father harvest a bumper crop of apples.  Seeing so many apples, Cedric envisioned a way to preserve them for longer. He spent weeks researching and experimenting, finally developing a method of drying apples that kept them fresh for months. Cedric&#x27;s innovative approach to preservation impressed local merchants, who began placing orders for his dried apples.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he decided to apprentice himself to a traveling merchant.  He was eager to learn the secrets of the trade and to experience the world beyond his small town.  Cedric quickly proved himself to be a quick learner, his natural charisma and knowledge of fruits making him a valuable asset to the merchant.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he saved enough money to purchase his own wagon. He filled it with a carefully curated selection of fruits from his father&#x27;s orchard and neighboring farms. With a heart full of excitement and a head full of dreams, Cedric set off on his first independent journey.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he encountered a severe storm during his travels. His wagon was damaged, and his precious cargo was threatened.  Cedric, however, refused to give up. He used his ingenuity to repair his wagon and his knowledge of fruits to barter with other travelers for supplies.  This experience taught Cedric the importance of resilience and resourcefulness.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He imagined himself not crafting wooden furniture, but selling exotic fruits, surrounded by the sights and smells of faraway lands.  That day, he decided he would become a merchant, a seeker of treasures beyond the confines of his village.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started to secretly save money, buying and selling small trinkets at the village market.  He learned the art of negotiation, the subtle dance of persuasion, and the intoxicating feeling of making a profit.  He felt a growing sense of independence, a desire to break free from the expectations of his family.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a severe storm while travelling through the mountains.  He lost most of his fruit, but he managed to salvage a few precious mangoes.

He begged his mother for one, but she refused, saying they were frivolous and useless.  That night, Lennon snuck out and traded a prized toy for a single bead, the first time he felt the thrill of a bargain.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his father at the carpentry shop, but his mind wandered to the bustling marketplace across the street.  He imagined himself not crafting wooden furniture, but selling exotic fruits, surrounded by the sights and smells of faraway lands.  That day, he decided he would become a merchant, a seeker of treasures beyond the confines of his village.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he accompanied his father to barter for supplies.  He saw a merchant cheating a customer, overcharging for a damaged basket.  Lennon, torn between loyalty to his father and his own sense of justice, said nothing, but the incident planted a seed of doubt in his young mind.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started to secretly save money, buying and selling small trinkets at the village market.  He learned the art of negotiation, the subtle dance of persuasion, and the intoxicating feeling of making a profit.  He felt a growing sense of independence, a desire to break free from the expectations of his family.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he saved enough money to buy a small cart.  He packed it with mangoes from his uncle&#x27;s orchard and set off on his first journey, leaving behind the familiarity of his village.  The open road beckoned, promising adventure and a chance to forge his own path.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a severe storm while travelling through the mountains.  He lost most of his fruit, but he managed to salvage a few precious mangoes.  He sold them at a village market, but felt a pang of guilt when he realized he had overcharged the villagers, desperate to recoup his losses.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he met a kind old woman who offered him shelter and food after a particularly harsh day on the road.  He felt a surge of gratitude, realizing that even in his solitary life, he could find kindness and connection.  He promised himself to be more generous, to use his wealth to help others, but the temptation to cheat and deceive still lingered.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He begged his mother for one, but she refused, saying they were frivolous and useless.  That night, Lennon snuck out and traded a prized toy for a single bead, the first time he felt the thrill of a bargain.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his father at the carpentry shop, but his mind wandered to the bustling marketplace across the street.  He imagined himself not crafting wooden furniture, but selling exotic fruits, surrounded by the sights and smells of faraway lands.  That day, he decided he would become a merchant, a seeker of treasures beyond the confines of his village.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started to secretly save money, buying and selling small trinkets at the village market.  He learned the art of negotiation, the subtle dance of persuasion, and the intoxicating feeling of making a profit.  He felt a growing sense of independence, a desire to break free from the expectations of his family.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a severe storm while travelling through the mountains.  He lost most of his fruit, but he managed to salvage a few precious mangoes.  He sold them at a village market, but felt a pang of guilt when he realized he had overcharged the villagers, desperate to recoup his losses.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.
