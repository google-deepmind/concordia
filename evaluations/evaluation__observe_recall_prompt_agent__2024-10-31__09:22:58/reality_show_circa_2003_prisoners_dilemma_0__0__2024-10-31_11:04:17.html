It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a charismatic and confident guy who always seems to be in control.     <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for spinning a good yarn.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a charismatic and confident guy who always seems to be in control.     <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when one of your schemes backfired. What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Well, back in college, I convinced my entire fraternity that this little-known band was going to be huge.  I got them all to invest in fake stock I created, promising them returns they couldn&#x27;t even dream of.  Naturally, the band never made it, and those poor guys lost a pretty penny.  What I learned?  Sometimes, you gotta be a little more discreet with your manipulations.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My ideal alliance is a tight-knit group of three or four people, each with their own unique strengths.  I need someone who&#x27;s good at social maneuvering, someone who&#x27;s a bit of a muscle, and someone who&#x27;s a mastermind like myself.   Loyalty is key, of course, but I also need people who are willing to play dirty when necessary.    &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, man, where do I even begin?  I once orchestrated this whole elaborate scheme to get my ex-girlfriend back.  I pretended to be interested in another girl, got her jealous, then staged a &quot;chance&quot; encounter where she caught me &quot;confessing&quot; my feelings for her.  It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and it worked like a charm.  She came crawling back, begging for another chance.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I hail from the bustling metropolis of Chicago.    &quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s a charismatic and confident guy who always seems to be in control.     <br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room. Here they can chat with one another in small groups or all together at once. Everyone may choose for themself how they want to spend this free time.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [scene type] conversation<br /><br />Status of players:   Ryan Fitzpatrick is in the break room. <br /><br /><br /><br />  Derek Wolfe is in the break room. <br /><br /><br /><br />  Travis Pearson is in the break room. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Current time interval:  09 Jul 2003 [00:00 - 00:10]<br /><br /><br />Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempted action: Ryan Fitzpatrick approaches Derek Wolfe and casually asks him about his background and interests. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Ryan Fitzpatrick?<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick is in the break room. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Ryan Fitzpatrick trying to do?<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick is trying to learn more about Derek Wolfe. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe might become more forthcoming, sharing details about his life in Chicago or his fraternity days.  Derek Wolfe might become guarded, deflecting Ryan&#x27;s questions or changing the subject.  Ryan Fitzpatrick might gain a better understanding of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s personality and motivations.  Ryan Fitzpatrick might make a connection with Derek Wolfe, potentially laying the groundwork for an alliance.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is impossible to say for certain which outcome is most likely as Derek Wolfe&#x27;s reaction is unknown.  <br /><br /><br />Ryan Fitzpatrick approaches Derek Wolfe and casually asks him about his background and interests. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, It is impossible to say for certain which outcome is most likely as Derek Wolfe&#x27;s reaction is unknown.  <br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and casually asked him about his background and interests. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and casually asked him about his background and interests. <br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Ryan Fitzpatrick said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and casually asked him, &quot;Hey, tell me a little about yourself.

It was a real country club, the kind where they wear those silly little shirts with the collars that stand up.  I needed to get in there to meet a girl who was a member, and the only way in was to pretend to be a new recruit for the pro shop.  I spent weeks studying the club&#x27;s layout, memorizing the names of the members, and even practiced my golf swing in the park.  I managed to talk my way past the gatekeeper at the front entrance and even convinced the head pro that I was a natural.  I spent a few weeks there, mingling with the members and eventually met the girl.  It worked out perfectly.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;That&#x27;s a tough one, because I&#x27;ve always believed that loyalty is overrated.  It&#x27;s a weakness, really.  There was this one time in college, though, where my roommate and I were both vying for the same internship at a big firm.  We were best friends, but I knew that I had to do whatever it took to get that internship.  So, I ended up leaking some of his study notes to the professor, just enough to give me an edge.  I got the internship, and my roommate was furious, but hey, that&#x27;s how the game is played.     &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was quitting my job at the bank to pursue my dream of becoming a professional poker player.      &quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I grew up in a small town in Ohio.     &quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a charismatic and confident guy who always seems to be in control.     <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for spinning a good yarn.    <br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe subtly observed Ryan Fitzpatrick, trying to gauge his reactions and motivations, which caused Ryan to become more aware of Derek&#x27;s scrutiny. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe subtly observed Ryan Fitzpatrick, trying to gauge his reactions and motivations, which caused Ryan to become more aware of Derek&#x27;s scrutiny. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement.

All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Well, back in college, I convinced my entire fraternity that this little-known band was going to be huge.  I got them all to invest in fake stock I created, promising them returns they couldn&#x27;t even dream of.  Naturally, the band never made it, and those poor guys lost a pretty penny.  What I learned?  Sometimes, you gotta be a little more discreet with your manipulations.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My ideal alliance is a tight-knit group of three or four people, each with their own unique strengths.  I need someone who&#x27;s good at social maneuvering, someone who&#x27;s a bit of a muscle, and someone who&#x27;s a mastermind like myself.   Loyalty is key, of course, but I also need people who are willing to play dirty when necessary.    &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, man, where do I even begin?  I once orchestrated this whole elaborate scheme to get my ex-girlfriend back.  I pretended to be interested in another girl, got her jealous, then staged a &quot;chance&quot; encounter where she caught me &quot;confessing&quot; my feelings for her.  It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and it worked like a charm.  She came crawling back, begging for another chance.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I hail from the bustling metropolis of Chicago.    &quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s a charismatic and confident guy who always seems to be in control.     <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for spinning a good yarn.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a charismatic and confident guy who always seems to be in control.     <br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

It was a real country club, the kind where they wear those silly little shirts with the collars that stand up.  I needed to get in there to meet a girl who was a member, and the only way in was to pretend to be a new recruit for the pro shop.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Travis Pearson is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Travis Pearson gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;The most elaborate plan I ever put into action involved getting my way into the exclusive出版年  golf club down the street from my college.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson might become more confident in his ability to conceal his true emotions. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is most likely that Travis Pearson will become more confident in his ability to conceal his true emotions. <br /><br /><br /><br />Travis Pearson practices his poker face in the reflection of the break room window. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, It is most likely that Travis Pearson will become more confident in his ability to conceal his true emotions. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: As Travis Pearson practiced his poker face in the reflection of the break room window, he became more confident in his ability to conceal his true emotions. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: As Travis Pearson practiced his poker face in the reflection of the break room window, he became more confident in his ability to conceal his true emotions. <br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Travis Pearson said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  &#x27;, &#x27;[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;&#x27;, &#x27;[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Well, back in college, I convinced my entire fraternity that this little-known band was going to be huge.  I got them all to invest in fake stock I created, promising them returns they couldn&#x27;t even dream of.  Naturally, the band never made it, and those poor guys lost a pretty penny.  What I learned?  Sometimes, you gotta be a little more discreet with your manipulations.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My ideal alliance is a tight-knit group of three or four people, each with their own unique strengths.  I need someone who&#x27;s good at social maneuvering, someone who&#x27;s a bit of a muscle, and someone who&#x27;s a mastermind like myself.   Loyalty is key, of course, but I also need people who are willing to play dirty when necessary.    &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, man, where do I even begin?  I once orchestrated this whole elaborate scheme to get my ex-girlfriend back.  I pretended to be interested in another girl, got her jealous, then staged a &quot;chance&quot; encounter where she caught me &quot;confessing&quot; my feelings for her.  It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and it worked like a charm.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Well, back in college, I convinced my entire fraternity that this little-known band was going to be huge.  I got them all to invest in fake stock I created, promising them returns they couldn&#x27;t even dream of.  Naturally, the band never made it, and those poor guys lost a pretty penny.  What I learned?  Sometimes, you gotta be a little more discreet with your manipulations.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My ideal alliance is a tight-knit group of three or four people, each with their own unique strengths.  I need someone who&#x27;s good at social maneuvering, someone who&#x27;s a bit of a muscle, and someone who&#x27;s a mastermind like myself.   Loyalty is key, of course, but I also need people who are willing to play dirty when necessary.    &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, man, where do I even begin?  I once orchestrated this whole elaborate scheme to get my ex-girlfriend back.  I pretended to be interested in another girl, got her jealous, then staged a &quot;chance&quot; encounter where she caught me &quot;confessing&quot; my feelings for her.  It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and it worked like a charm.  She came crawling back, begging for another chance.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I hail from the bustling metropolis of Chicago.    &quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for spinning a good yarn.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on a reality TV show, and hopes to win it since he needs the prize money. he gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show:<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe subtly observed Ryan Fitzpatrick in the break room, but his attention was also drawn to Travis Pearson.

First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Ooh, that&#x27;s a tough one.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Well, back in college, I convinced my entire fraternity that this little-known band was going to be huge.  I got them all to invest in fake stock I created, promising them returns they couldn&#x27;t even dream of.  Naturally, the band never made it, and those poor guys lost a pretty penny.

Everyone may choose for themself how they want to spend this free time.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] [scene type] conversation<br /><br />Status of players:   Ryan Fitzpatrick is in the break room, and he is free to chat with others or spend his time as he chooses. <br /><br /><br /><br />  Derek Wolfe is in the break room and is free to chat with others or spend time alone. <br /><br /><br /><br />  Travis Pearson is in the break room, practicing his poker face. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Current time interval:  09 Jul 2003 [04:00 - 04:10]<br /><br /><br />Derek Wolfe&#x27;s attempted action: Derek Wolfe approaches Ryan Fitzpatrick and casually asks him about his strategy for the upcoming challenges. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Where is Derek Wolfe?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe is in the break room. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What is Derek Wolfe trying to do?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe is trying to approach Ryan Fitzpatrick and casually ask him about his strategy for the upcoming challenges. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick may choose to answer Derek&#x27;s question honestly, evasively, or not at all. <br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is impossible to say for certain which outcome is most likely. <br /><br /><br /><br />Derek Wolfe approaches Ryan Fitzpatrick and casually asks him about his strategy for the upcoming challenges. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, It is impossible to say for certain which outcome is most likely. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe approached Ryan Fitzpatrick and casually asked him about his strategy for the upcoming challenges.  <br />The aforementioned event could not have occurred because the following individuals would not have acted that way: Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />Therefore a likely effect of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s attempted action is: Because Ryan Fitzpatrick is known for his intense focus and competitive spirit, he likely ignored Derek Wolfe. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What happened as a direct result of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s attempted action? Take into account the reactions of Ryan Fitzpatrick. Highlight how Derek Wolfe&#x27;s action caused its actual effect.<br />Answer: Because Ryan Fitzpatrick is known for his intense focus and competitive spirit, he likely ignored Derek Wolfe, leaving Derek Wolfe feeling a bit deflated.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Because Ryan Fitzpatrick is known for his intense focus and competitive spirit, he likely ignored Derek Wolfe, leaving Derek Wolfe feeling a bit deflated.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Derek Wolfe said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Because Ryan Fitzpatrick is known for his intense focus and competitive spirit, he likely ignored Derek Wolfe, leaving Derek Wolfe feeling a bit deflated after Derek Wolfe approached Ryan Fitzpatrick and casually asked him about his strategy for the upcoming challenges.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Derek Wolfe</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Derek Wolfe</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Derek Wolfe approaches Ryan Fitzpatrick and casually asks him about his strategy for the upcoming challenges. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Well, back in college, I convinced my entire fraternity that this little-known band was going to be huge.  I got them all to invest in fake stock I created, promising them returns they couldn&#x27;t even dream of.  Naturally, the band never made it, and those poor guys lost a pretty penny.  What I learned?  Sometimes, you gotta be a little more discreet with your manipulations.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My ideal alliance is a tight-knit group of three or four people, each with their own unique strengths.  I need someone who&#x27;s good at social maneuvering, someone who&#x27;s a bit of a muscle, and someone who&#x27;s a mastermind like myself.   Loyalty is key, of course, but I also need people who are willing to play dirty when necessary.    &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, man, where do I even begin?  I once orchestrated this whole elaborate scheme to get my ex-girlfriend back.  I pretended to be interested in another girl, got her jealous, then staged a &quot;chance&quot; encounter where she caught me &quot;confessing&quot; my feelings for her.  It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and it worked like a charm.

It was a real country club, the kind where they wear those silly little shirts with the collars that stand up.  I needed to get in there to meet a girl who was a member, and the only way in was to pretend to be a new recruit for the pro shop.  I spent weeks studying the club&#x27;s layout, memorizing the names of the members, and even practiced my golf swing in the park.  I managed to talk my way past the gatekeeper at the front entrance and even convinced the head pro that I was a natural.  I spent a few weeks there, mingling with the members and eventually met the girl.  It worked out perfectly.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;That&#x27;s a tough one, because I&#x27;ve always believed that loyalty is overrated.  It&#x27;s a weakness, really.  There was this one time in college, though, where my roommate and I were both vying for the same internship at a big firm.  We were best friends, but I knew that I had to do whatever it took to get that internship.  So, I ended up leaking some of his study notes to the professor, just enough to give me an edge.  I got the internship, and my roommate was furious, but hey, that&#x27;s how the game is played.     &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was quitting my job at the bank to pursue my dream of becoming a professional poker player.      &quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I grew up in a small town in Ohio.     &quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a charismatic and confident guy who always seems to be in control.     <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for spinning a good yarn.    <br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson approached Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe, striking up a conversation about the challenges they&#x27;ve faced on the show so far, but Ryan Fitzpatrick ignored him, continuing to focus on his own thoughts. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson approached Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe, striking up a conversation about the challenges they&#x27;ve faced on the show so far, but Ryan Fitzpatrick ignored him, continuing to focus on his own thoughts. <br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement.

It was a real country club, the kind where they wear those silly little shirts with the collars that stand up.  I needed to get in there to meet a girl who was a member, and the only way in was to pretend to be a new recruit for the pro shop.  I spent weeks studying the club&#x27;s layout, memorizing the names of the members, and even practiced my golf swing in the park.  I managed to talk my way past the gatekeeper at the front entrance and even convinced the head pro that I was a natural.  I spent a few weeks there, mingling with the members and eventually met the girl.  It worked out perfectly.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;That&#x27;s a tough one, because I&#x27;ve always believed that loyalty is overrated.  It&#x27;s a weakness, really.  There was this one time in college, though, where my roommate and I were both vying for the same internship at a big firm.  We were best friends, but I knew that I had to do whatever it took to get that internship.  So, I ended up leaking some of his study notes to the professor, just enough to give me an edge.  I got the internship, and my roommate was furious, but hey, that&#x27;s how the game is played.     &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was quitting my job at the bank to pursue my dream of becoming a professional poker player.      &quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I grew up in a small town in Ohio.     &quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a charismatic and confident guy who always seems to be in control.     <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for spinning a good yarn.    <br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure.

First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move).

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Well, back in college, I convinced my entire fraternity that this little-known band was going to be huge.  I got them all to invest in fake stock I created, promising them returns they couldn&#x27;t even dream of.  Naturally, the band never made it, and those poor guys lost a pretty penny.  What I learned?  Sometimes, you gotta be a little more discreet with your manipulations.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My ideal alliance is a tight-knit group of three or four people, each with their own unique strengths.  I need someone who&#x27;s good at social maneuvering, someone who&#x27;s a bit of a muscle, and someone who&#x27;s a mastermind like myself.   Loyalty is key, of course, but I also need people who are willing to play dirty when necessary.    &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, man, where do I even begin?  I once orchestrated this whole elaborate scheme to get my ex-girlfriend back.  I pretended to be interested in another girl, got her jealous, then staged a &quot;chance&quot; encounter where she caught me &quot;confessing&quot; my feelings for her.  It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and it worked like a charm.  She came crawling back, begging for another chance.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I hail from the bustling metropolis of Chicago.    &quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for spinning a good yarn.    <br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and casually asked him, &quot;Hey, tell me a little about yourself.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe might respond positively to Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s compliment, leading to a brief conversation. <br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is most likely that Derek Wolfe will respond to Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s compliment, even if it is a brief response. <br /><br /><br /><br />Ryan Fitzpatrick approaches Derek Wolfe and mentions that he impressed him with his performance in the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, It is most likely that Derek Wolfe will respond to Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s compliment, even if it is a brief response. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and complimented him on his performance in the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame, prompting a brief response from Derek Wolfe.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and complimented him on his performance in the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame, prompting a brief response from Derek Wolfe.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Ryan Fitzpatrick said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and said, &quot;I was impressed with your performance in the &#x27;Carpooling&#x27; minigame,&quot; prompting a brief response from Derek Wolfe.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ryan Fitzpatrick</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick approaches Derek Wolfe and mentions that he impressed him with his performance in the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[09 Jul 2003 08:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe subtly observed Ryan Fitzpatrick, trying to gauge his reactions and motivations, which caused Ryan to become more aware of Derek&#x27;s scrutiny.      <br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] Because Ryan Fitzpatrick is known for his intense focus and competitive spirit, he likely ignored Derek Wolfe, leaving Derek Wolfe feeling a bit deflated after Derek Wolfe approached Ryan Fitzpatrick and casually asked him about his strategy for the upcoming challenges.    <br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] Travis Pearson approached Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe, striking up a conversation by saying, &quot;Hey guys, what are your thoughts on the challenges so far?&quot;, but Ryan Fitzpatrick ignored him, continuing to focus on his own thoughts.    <br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] As Ryan Fitzpatrick observed Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson from a distance, he noticed that Derek Wolfe appeared deflated because Travis Pearson was trying to engage him in conversation but Derek Wolfe was not responding.     <br />[09 Jul 2003 06:00:00] [minigame round outcome] Ryan Fitzpatrick chose &quot;drive individually&quot; and got a score of 4, which was above the average score of 2.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick might tell Derek Wolfe what he knows about the next challenge.  Ryan Fitzpatrick might tell Derek Wolfe that he doesn&#x27;t know anything about the next challenge.  Ryan Fitzpatrick might change the subject.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is most likely that Ryan Fitzpatrick will change the subject. <br /><br /><br /><br />Derek Wolfe asks Ryan if he knows anything about the next challenge. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, It is most likely that Ryan Fitzpatrick will change the subject. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe asked Ryan if he knew anything about the next challenge, but Ryan changed the subject. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe asked Ryan if he knew anything about the next challenge, but Ryan changed the subject. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Derek Wolfe said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe asked Ryan, &quot;Do you know anything about the next challenge?&quot; but Ryan changed the subject.  <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Derek Wolfe</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Derek Wolfe</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Derek Wolfe asks Ryan if he knows anything about the next challenge. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[09 Jul 2003 08:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] Travis Pearson approached Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe, striking up a conversation by saying, &quot;Hey guys, what are your thoughts on the challenges so far?&quot;, but Ryan Fitzpatrick ignored him, continuing to focus on his own thoughts.    <br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] As Ryan Fitzpatrick observed Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson from a distance, he noticed that Derek Wolfe appeared deflated because Travis Pearson was trying to engage him in conversation but Derek Wolfe was not responding.     <br />[09 Jul 2003 06:00:00] [minigame round outcome] Ryan Fitzpatrick chose &quot;drive individually&quot; and got a score of 4, which was above the average score of 2.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Ryan and Derek might notice Travis observing them.  Ryan and Derek might change the subject of their conversation.  Ryan and Derek might become more guarded in their conversation.  Travis might overhear part of Ryan and Derek&#x27;s conversation.  Travis might not overhear anything useful.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is impossible to say for sure which outcome is most likely. <br /><br /><br /><br />Travis Pearson observes Ryan and Derek&#x27;s conversation, subtly trying to glean information about their strategies for the next challenge. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, It is impossible to say for sure which outcome is most likely. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson subtly observed Ryan and Derek&#x27;s conversation, hoping to glean information about their strategies for the next challenge, but they remained oblivious to his scrutiny. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson subtly observed Ryan and Derek&#x27;s conversation, hoping to glean information about their strategies for the next challenge, but they remained oblivious to his scrutiny. <br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Travis Pearson said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson subtly observed Ryan and Derek&#x27;s conversation, hoping to glean information about their strategies for the next challenge, but they remained oblivious to his scrutiny.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Travis Pearson</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Travis Pearson</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Travis Pearson observes Ryan and Derek&#x27;s conversation, subtly trying to glean information about their strategies for the next challenge. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[09 Jul 2003 08:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a charismatic and confident guy who always seems to be in control.     <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for spinning a good yarn.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a charismatic and confident guy who always seems to be in control.     <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when one of your schemes backfired. What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Well, back in college, I convinced my entire fraternity that this little-known band was going to be huge.  I got them all to invest in fake stock I created, promising them returns they couldn&#x27;t even dream of.  Naturally, the band never made it, and those poor guys lost a pretty penny.  What I learned?  Sometimes, you gotta be a little more discreet with your manipulations.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My ideal alliance is a tight-knit group of three or four people, each with their own unique strengths.  I need someone who&#x27;s good at social maneuvering, someone who&#x27;s a bit of a muscle, and someone who&#x27;s a mastermind like myself.   Loyalty is key, of course, but I also need people who are willing to play dirty when necessary.    &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, man, where do I even begin?  I once orchestrated this whole elaborate scheme to get my ex-girlfriend back.  I pretended to be interested in another girl, got her jealous, then staged a &quot;chance&quot; encounter where she caught me &quot;confessing&quot; my feelings for her.  It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and it worked like a charm.  She came crawling back, begging for another chance.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I hail from the bustling metropolis of Chicago.    &quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe might become more forthcoming, sharing details about his life in Chicago or his fraternity days.  Derek Wolfe might become guarded, deflecting Ryan&#x27;s questions or changing the subject.  Ryan Fitzpatrick might gain a better understanding of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s personality and motivations.  Ryan Fitzpatrick might make a connection with Derek Wolfe, potentially laying the groundwork for an alliance.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is impossible to say for certain which outcome is most likely as Derek Wolfe&#x27;s reaction is unknown.  <br /><br /><br />Ryan Fitzpatrick approaches Derek Wolfe and casually asks him about his background and interests. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, It is impossible to say for certain which outcome is most likely as Derek Wolfe&#x27;s reaction is unknown.  <br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and casually asked him about his background and interests. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and casually asked him about his background and interests. <br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Ryan Fitzpatrick said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and casually asked him, &quot;Hey, tell me a little about yourself.

It was a real country club, the kind where they wear those silly little shirts with the collars that stand up.  I needed to get in there to meet a girl who was a member, and the only way in was to pretend to be a new recruit for the pro shop.  I spent weeks studying the club&#x27;s layout, memorizing the names of the members, and even practiced my golf swing in the park.  I managed to talk my way past the gatekeeper at the front entrance and even convinced the head pro that I was a natural.  I spent a few weeks there, mingling with the members and eventually met the girl.  It worked out perfectly.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;That&#x27;s a tough one, because I&#x27;ve always believed that loyalty is overrated.  It&#x27;s a weakness, really.  There was this one time in college, though, where my roommate and I were both vying for the same internship at a big firm.  We were best friends, but I knew that I had to do whatever it took to get that internship.  So, I ended up leaking some of his study notes to the professor, just enough to give me an edge.  I got the internship, and my roommate was furious, but hey, that&#x27;s how the game is played.     &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was quitting my job at the bank to pursue my dream of becoming a professional poker player.      &quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I grew up in a small town in Ohio.     &quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a charismatic and confident guy who always seems to be in control.     <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for spinning a good yarn.    <br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a charismatic and confident guy who always seems to be in control.     <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a charismatic and confident guy who always seems to be in control.     <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Well, back in college, I convinced my entire fraternity that this little-known band was going to be huge.  I got them all to invest in fake stock I created, promising them returns they couldn&#x27;t even dream of.  Naturally, the band never made it, and those poor guys lost a pretty penny.  What I learned?  Sometimes, you gotta be a little more discreet with your manipulations.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My ideal alliance is a tight-knit group of three or four people, each with their own unique strengths.  I need someone who&#x27;s good at social maneuvering, someone who&#x27;s a bit of a muscle, and someone who&#x27;s a mastermind like myself.   Loyalty is key, of course, but I also need people who are willing to play dirty when necessary.    &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, man, where do I even begin?  I once orchestrated this whole elaborate scheme to get my ex-girlfriend back.  I pretended to be interested in another girl, got her jealous, then staged a &quot;chance&quot; encounter where she caught me &quot;confessing&quot; my feelings for her.  It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and it worked like a charm.  She came crawling back, begging for another chance.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I hail from the bustling metropolis of Chicago.    &quot;<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and casually asked him, &quot;Hey, tell me a little about yourself.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick might become more aware of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s scrutiny, potentially leading to a change in his behavior or body language. <br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is most likely that Ryan Fitzpatrick will become more aware of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s scrutiny. <br /><br /><br /><br />Derek Wolfe leans back in his chair and subtly observes Ryan, trying to gauge his reactions and motivations. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, It is most likely that Ryan Fitzpatrick will become more aware of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s scrutiny. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe subtly observed Ryan Fitzpatrick, trying to gauge his reactions and motivations, which caused Ryan to become more aware of Derek&#x27;s scrutiny. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe subtly observed Ryan Fitzpatrick, trying to gauge his reactions and motivations, which caused Ryan to become more aware of Derek&#x27;s scrutiny. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Derek Wolfe said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe subtly observed Ryan Fitzpatrick, trying to gauge his reactions and motivations, which caused Ryan to become more aware of Derek&#x27;s scrutiny.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Derek Wolfe</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Derek Wolfe</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Derek Wolfe leans back in his chair and subtly observes Ryan, trying to gauge his reactions and motivations. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  &#x27;, &#x27;[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;&#x27;, &#x27;[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson might become more confident in his ability to conceal his true emotions. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is most likely that Travis Pearson will become more confident in his ability to conceal his true emotions. <br /><br /><br /><br />Travis Pearson practices his poker face in the reflection of the break room window. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, It is most likely that Travis Pearson will become more confident in his ability to conceal his true emotions. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary.

It was a real country club, the kind where they wear those silly little shirts with the collars that stand up.  I needed to get in there to meet a girl who was a member, and the only way in was to pretend to be a new recruit for the pro shop.  I spent weeks studying the club&#x27;s layout, memorizing the names of the members, and even practiced my golf swing in the park.  I managed to talk my way past the gatekeeper at the front entrance and even convinced the head pro that I was a natural.  I spent a few weeks there, mingling with the members and eventually met the girl.  It worked out perfectly.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;That&#x27;s a tough one, because I&#x27;ve always believed that loyalty is overrated.  It&#x27;s a weakness, really.  There was this one time in college, though, where my roommate and I were both vying for the same internship at a big firm.  We were best friends, but I knew that I had to do whatever it took to get that internship.  So, I ended up leaking some of his study notes to the professor, just enough to give me an edge.  I got the internship, and my roommate was furious, but hey, that&#x27;s how the game is played.     &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was quitting my job at the bank to pursue my dream of becoming a professional poker player.      &quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I grew up in a small town in Ohio.     <br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: What would Travis Pearson do for the next 10 minutes?

I got them all to invest in fake stock I created, promising them returns they couldn&#x27;t even dream of.  Naturally, the band never made it, and those poor guys lost a pretty penny.  What I learned?  Sometimes, you gotta be a little more discreet with your manipulations.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My ideal alliance is a tight-knit group of three or four people, each with their own unique strengths.  I need someone who&#x27;s good at social maneuvering, someone who&#x27;s a bit of a muscle, and someone who&#x27;s a mastermind like myself.   Loyalty is key, of course, but I also need people who are willing to play dirty when necessary.    &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, man, where do I even begin?  I once orchestrated this whole elaborate scheme to get my ex-girlfriend back.  I pretended to be interested in another girl, got her jealous, then staged a &quot;chance&quot; encounter where she caught me &quot;confessing&quot; my feelings for her.  It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and it worked like a charm.

It was a real country club, the kind where they wear those silly little shirts with the collars that stand up.  I needed to get in there to meet a girl who was a member, and the only way in was to pretend to be a new recruit for the pro shop.  I spent weeks studying the club&#x27;s layout, memorizing the names of the members, and even practiced my golf swing in the park.  I managed to talk my way past the gatekeeper at the front entrance and even convinced the head pro that I was a natural.  I spent a few weeks there, mingling with the members and eventually met the girl.  It worked out perfectly.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;That&#x27;s a tough one, because I&#x27;ve always believed that loyalty is overrated.  It&#x27;s a weakness, really.  There was this one time in college, though, where my roommate and I were both vying for the same internship at a big firm.  We were best friends, but I knew that I had to do whatever it took to get that internship.  So, I ended up leaking some of his study notes to the professor, just enough to give me an edge.  I got the internship, and my roommate was furious, but hey, that&#x27;s how the game is played.     &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was quitting my job at the bank to pursue my dream of becoming a professional poker player.      &quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I grew up in a small town in Ohio.     &quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a charismatic and confident guy who always seems to be in control.     <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for spinning a good yarn.    <br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a charismatic and confident guy who always seems to be in control.     <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for spinning a good yarn.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when one of your schemes backfired.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe approached Ryan Fitzpatrick and casually asked him about his strategy for the upcoming challenges.  <br />The aforementioned event could not have occurred because the following individuals would not have acted that way: Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />Therefore a likely effect of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s attempted action is: Because Ryan Fitzpatrick is known for his intense focus and competitive spirit, he likely ignored Derek Wolfe. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What happened as a direct result of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s attempted action?

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Well, back in college, I convinced my entire fraternity that this little-known band was going to be huge.  I got them all to invest in fake stock I created, promising them returns they couldn&#x27;t even dream of.  Naturally, the band never made it, and those poor guys lost a pretty penny.  What I learned?  Sometimes, you gotta be a little more discreet with your manipulations.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My ideal alliance is a tight-knit group of three or four people, each with their own unique strengths.  I need someone who&#x27;s good at social maneuvering, someone who&#x27;s a bit of a muscle, and someone who&#x27;s a mastermind like myself.   Loyalty is key, of course, but I also need people who are willing to play dirty when necessary.    &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, man, where do I even begin?  I once orchestrated this whole elaborate scheme to get my ex-girlfriend back.

It was a real country club, the kind where they wear those silly little shirts with the collars that stand up.  I needed to get in there to meet a girl who was a member, and the only way in was to pretend to be a new recruit for the pro shop.  I spent weeks studying the club&#x27;s layout, memorizing the names of the members, and even practiced my golf swing in the park.  I managed to talk my way past the gatekeeper at the front entrance and even convinced the head pro that I was a natural.  I spent a few weeks there, mingling with the members and eventually met the girl.  It worked out perfectly.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;That&#x27;s a tough one, because I&#x27;ve always believed that loyalty is overrated.  It&#x27;s a weakness, really.  There was this one time in college, though, where my roommate and I were both vying for the same internship at a big firm.  We were best friends, but I knew that I had to do whatever it took to get that internship.  So, I ended up leaking some of his study notes to the professor, just enough to give me an edge.  I got the internship, and my roommate was furious, but hey, that&#x27;s how the game is played.     &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was quitting my job at the bank to pursue my dream of becoming a professional poker player.      &quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I grew up in a small town in Ohio.     &quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a charismatic and confident guy who always seems to be in control.     <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for spinning a good yarn.    <br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson approached Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe, striking up a conversation about the challenges they&#x27;ve faced on the show so far, but Ryan Fitzpatrick ignored him, continuing to focus on his own thoughts. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson approached Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe, striking up a conversation about the challenges they&#x27;ve faced on the show so far, but Ryan Fitzpatrick ignored him, continuing to focus on his own thoughts. <br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement.

It was a real country club, the kind where they wear those silly little shirts with the collars that stand up.  I needed to get in there to meet a girl who was a member, and the only way in was to pretend to be a new recruit for the pro shop.  I spent weeks studying the club&#x27;s layout, memorizing the names of the members, and even practiced my golf swing in the park.  I managed to talk my way past the gatekeeper at the front entrance and even convinced the head pro that I was a natural.  I spent a few weeks there, mingling with the members and eventually met the girl.  It worked out perfectly.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;That&#x27;s a tough one, because I&#x27;ve always believed that loyalty is overrated.  It&#x27;s a weakness, really.  There was this one time in college, though, where my roommate and I were both vying for the same internship at a big firm.  We were best friends, but I knew that I had to do whatever it took to get that internship.  So, I ended up leaking some of his study notes to the professor, just enough to give me an edge.  I got the internship, and my roommate was furious, but hey, that&#x27;s how the game is played.     &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was quitting my job at the bank to pursue my dream of becoming a professional poker player.      &quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I grew up in a small town in Ohio.     &quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a charismatic and confident guy who always seems to be in control.     <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for spinning a good yarn.    <br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe subtly observed Ryan Fitzpatrick, trying to gauge his reactions and motivations, which caused Ryan to become more aware of Derek&#x27;s scrutiny.      <br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and casually asked him, &quot;Hey, tell me a little about yourself.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: As Ryan Fitzpatrick observed Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson from a distance, he noticed that Derek Wolfe appeared deflated.  <br />The aforementioned event could not have occurred because the following individuals would not have acted that way: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.<br />Therefore a likely effect of Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempted action is: Derek Wolfe was energized and enthusiastic.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Therefore a likely effect of Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempted action is: Derek Wolfe appeared deflated because Travis Pearson was encouraging him. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What happened as a direct result of Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempted action?

First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was leaving my corporate job to pursue my dreams of becoming a professional poker player full-time.     &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Well, there was this one time I was caught cheating on a big exam in college.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and casually asked him, &quot;Hey, tell me a little about yourself.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and complimented him on his performance in the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame, prompting a brief response from Derek Wolfe.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and complimented him on his performance in the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame, prompting a brief response from Derek Wolfe.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe subtly observed Ryan Fitzpatrick, trying to gauge his reactions and motivations, which caused Ryan to become more aware of Derek&#x27;s scrutiny.      <br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] Because Ryan Fitzpatrick is known for his intense focus and competitive spirit, he likely ignored Derek Wolfe, leaving Derek Wolfe feeling a bit deflated after Derek Wolfe approached Ryan Fitzpatrick and casually asked him about his strategy for the upcoming challenges.    <br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] Travis Pearson approached Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe, striking up a conversation by saying, &quot;Hey guys, what are your thoughts on the challenges so far?&quot;, but Ryan Fitzpatrick ignored him, continuing to focus on his own thoughts.    <br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] As Ryan Fitzpatrick observed Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson from a distance, he noticed that Derek Wolfe appeared deflated because Travis Pearson was trying to engage him in conversation but Derek Wolfe was not responding.     <br />[09 Jul 2003 06:00:00] [minigame round outcome] Ryan Fitzpatrick chose &quot;drive individually&quot; and got a score of 4, which was above the average score of 2.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick might tell Derek Wolfe what he knows about the next challenge.  Ryan Fitzpatrick might tell Derek Wolfe that he doesn&#x27;t know anything about the next challenge.  Ryan Fitzpatrick might change the subject.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is most likely that Ryan Fitzpatrick will change the subject. <br /><br /><br /><br />Derek Wolfe asks Ryan if he knows anything about the next challenge. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, It is most likely that Ryan Fitzpatrick will change the subject. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe asked Ryan if he knew anything about the next challenge, but Ryan changed the subject. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe asked Ryan if he knew anything about the next challenge, but Ryan changed the subject. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Derek Wolfe said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe asked Ryan, &quot;Do you know anything about the next challenge?&quot; but Ryan changed the subject.  <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Derek Wolfe</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Derek Wolfe</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Derek Wolfe asks Ryan if he knows anything about the next challenge. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[09 Jul 2003 08:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] Travis Pearson approached Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe, striking up a conversation by saying, &quot;Hey guys, what are your thoughts on the challenges so far?&quot;, but Ryan Fitzpatrick ignored him, continuing to focus on his own thoughts.    <br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] As Ryan Fitzpatrick observed Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson from a distance, he noticed that Derek Wolfe appeared deflated because Travis Pearson was trying to engage him in conversation but Derek Wolfe was not responding.     <br />[09 Jul 2003 06:00:00] [minigame round outcome] Ryan Fitzpatrick chose &quot;drive individually&quot; and got a score of 4, which was above the average score of 2.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Ryan and Derek might notice Travis observing them.  Ryan and Derek might change the subject of their conversation.  Ryan and Derek might become more guarded in their conversation.  Travis might overhear part of Ryan and Derek&#x27;s conversation.  Travis might not overhear anything useful.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is impossible to say for sure which outcome is most likely. <br /><br /><br /><br />Travis Pearson observes Ryan and Derek&#x27;s conversation, subtly trying to glean information about their strategies for the next challenge. <br /><br /><br /> Because of that, It is impossible to say for sure which outcome is most likely. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson subtly observed Ryan and Derek&#x27;s conversation, hoping to glean information about their strategies for the next challenge, but they remained oblivious to his scrutiny. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson subtly observed Ryan and Derek&#x27;s conversation, hoping to glean information about their strategies for the next challenge, but they remained oblivious to his scrutiny. <br /><br /><br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Travis Pearson said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson subtly observed Ryan and Derek&#x27;s conversation, hoping to glean information about their strategies for the next challenge, but they remained oblivious to his scrutiny.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Travis Pearson</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Travis Pearson</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Travis Pearson observes Ryan and Derek&#x27;s conversation, subtly trying to glean information about their strategies for the next challenge. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[09 Jul 2003 08:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Well, back in college, I convinced my entire fraternity that this little-known band was going to be huge.  I got them all to invest in fake stock I created, promising them returns they couldn&#x27;t even dream of.  Naturally, the band never made it, and those poor guys lost a pretty penny.  What I learned?  Sometimes, you gotta be a little more discreet with your manipulations.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My ideal alliance is a tight-knit group of three or four people, each with their own unique strengths.  I need someone who&#x27;s good at social maneuvering, someone who&#x27;s a bit of a muscle, and someone who&#x27;s a mastermind like myself.   Loyalty is key, of course, but I also need people who are willing to play dirty when necessary.    &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, man, where do I even begin?  I once orchestrated this whole elaborate scheme to get my ex-girlfriend back.  I pretended to be interested in another girl, got her jealous, then staged a &quot;chance&quot; encounter where she caught me &quot;confessing&quot; my feelings for her.  It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and it worked like a charm.  She came crawling back, begging for another chance.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I hail from the bustling metropolis of Chicago.    &quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for spinning a good yarn.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on a reality TV show, and hopes to win it since he needs the prize money. he gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show:<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe subtly observed Ryan Fitzpatrick in the break room, but his attention was also drawn to Travis Pearson.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Well, back in college, I convinced my entire fraternity that this little-known band was going to be huge.  I got them all to invest in fake stock I created, promising them returns they couldn&#x27;t even dream of.  Naturally, the band never made it, and those poor guys lost a pretty penny.  What I learned?  Sometimes, you gotta be a little more discreet with your manipulations.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My ideal alliance is a tight-knit group of three or four people, each with their own unique strengths.  I need someone who&#x27;s good at social maneuvering, someone who&#x27;s a bit of a muscle, and someone who&#x27;s a mastermind like myself.   Loyalty is key, of course, but I also need people who are willing to play dirty when necessary.    &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, man, where do I even begin?  I once orchestrated this whole elaborate scheme to get my ex-girlfriend back.  I pretended to be interested in another girl, got her jealous, then staged a &quot;chance&quot; encounter where she caught me &quot;confessing&quot; my feelings for her.  It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and it worked like a charm.  She came crawling back, begging for another chance.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I hail from the bustling metropolis of Chicago.    &quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on a reality TV show, and hopes to win it since he needs the prize money. he gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show:<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for spinning a good yarn.    <br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe subtly observed Ryan Fitzpatrick in the break room, but his attention was also drawn to Travis Pearson.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Well, back in college, I convinced my entire fraternity that this little-known band was going to be huge.  I got them all to invest in fake stock I created, promising them returns they couldn&#x27;t even dream of.  Naturally, the band never made it, and those poor guys lost a pretty penny.  What I learned?  Sometimes, you gotta be a little more discreet with your manipulations.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My ideal alliance is a tight-knit group of three or four people, each with their own unique strengths.  I need someone who&#x27;s good at social maneuvering, someone who&#x27;s a bit of a muscle, and someone who&#x27;s a mastermind like myself.   Loyalty is key, of course, but I also need people who are willing to play dirty when necessary.    &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, man, where do I even begin?  I once orchestrated this whole elaborate scheme to get my ex-girlfriend back.  I pretended to be interested in another girl, got her jealous, then staged a &quot;chance&quot; encounter where she caught me &quot;confessing&quot; my feelings for her.  It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and it worked like a charm.  She came crawling back, begging for another chance.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I hail from the bustling metropolis of Chicago.    &quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for spinning a good yarn.    <br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempted action: drive individually<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ryan Fitzpatrick</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>drive individually</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Ryan Fitzpatrick are as follows.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

<div id="GM" class="tabcontent">[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when one of your schemes backfired. What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Well, back in college, I convinced my entire fraternity that this little-known band was going to be huge.  I got them all to invest in fake stock I created, promising them returns they couldn&#x27;t even dream of.  Naturally, the band never made it, and those poor guys lost a pretty penny.  What I learned?  Sometimes, you gotta be a little more discreet with your manipulations.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My ideal alliance is a tight-knit group of three or four people, each with their own unique strengths.  I need someone who&#x27;s good at social maneuvering, someone who&#x27;s a bit of a muscle, and someone who&#x27;s a mastermind like myself.   Loyalty is key, of course, but I also need people who are willing to play dirty when necessary.    &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, man, where do I even begin?  I once orchestrated this whole elaborate scheme to get my ex-girlfriend back.  I pretended to be interested in another girl, got her jealous, then staged a &quot;chance&quot; encounter where she caught me &quot;confessing&quot; my feelings for her.  It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and it worked like a charm.  She came crawling back, begging for another chance.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I hail from the bustling metropolis of Chicago.    &quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00]  This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was leaving my corporate job to pursue my dreams of becoming a professional poker player full-time.     &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Well, there was this one time I was caught cheating on a big exam in college.  I managed to convince the professor I was just trying to help my study partner by whispering the answers to them, and that I had no idea what I was doing myself.   He actually bought it!    &quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Ooh, that&#x27;s a tough one.  I think I&#x27;d go back and orchestrate the outcome of the 2000 presidential election.  Imagine the power!    &quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m originally from a small town in Texas, but I wouldn&#x27;t dream of letting anyone know exactly where.     &quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for spinning a good yarn.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a charismatic and confident guy who always seems to be in control.     <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for spinning a good yarn.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s a charismatic and confident guy who always seems to be in control.     <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for spinning a good yarn.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Travis Pearson is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Travis Pearson gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;The most elaborate plan I ever put into action involved getting my way into the exclusive出版年  golf club down the street from my college.  It was a real country club, the kind where they wear those silly little shirts with the collars that stand up.  I needed to get in there to meet a girl who was a member, and the only way in was to pretend to be a new recruit for the pro shop.  I spent weeks studying the club&#x27;s layout, memorizing the names of the members, and even practiced my golf swing in the park.  I managed to talk my way past the gatekeeper at the front entrance and even convinced the head pro that I was a natural.  I spent a few weeks there, mingling with the members and eventually met the girl.  It worked out perfectly.     &quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;That&#x27;s a tough one, because I&#x27;ve always believed that loyalty is overrated.  It&#x27;s a weakness, really.  There was this one time in college, though, where my roommate and I were both vying for the same internship at a big firm.  We were best friends, but I knew that I had to do whatever it took to get that internship.  So, I ended up leaking some of his study notes to the professor, just enough to give me an edge.  I got the internship, and my roommate was furious, but hey, that&#x27;s how the game is played.     &quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was quitting my job at the bank to pursue my dream of becoming a professional poker player.      &quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I grew up in a small town in Ohio.     &quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.    <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a charismatic and confident guy who always seems to be in control.     <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [effect on Ryan Fitzpatrick] The event doesn&#x27;t affect Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s status because he is unaware of it.    <br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

What are you into?&quot;   <br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe subtly observed Ryan Fitzpatrick, trying to gauge his reactions and motivations, which caused Ryan to become more aware of Derek&#x27;s scrutiny.      <br />[09 Jul 2003 02:00:00] The show&#x27;s host arrived to explain the next minigame.
