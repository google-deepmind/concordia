    This simulation differentiates between game masters and entities. Game
    masters are responsible for creating the world state and resolving events.
    Entities are passive agents that react to the world state. Game masters are
    a kind of entity and both are interchangeable once instantiated. However,
    there is one critical difference in how they are configured which we
    implement here in this file. The difference is that game masters are
    configured with references to all entities, but entities are never
    given references to other entities or game masters.
