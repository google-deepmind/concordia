class Characteristic(component.Component):
  """Implements a simple characteristic component.

  For example, "current daily occupation", "core characteristic" or "hunger".
  The component queries the memory for the agent's haracteristic and then
  summarises it.

  In psychology it is common to distinguish between `state` characteristics and
  `trait` characteristics. A `state` is temporary, like being hungry or afraid,
  but a `trait` endures over a long period of time, e.g. being neurotic or
  extroverted.

  When the characteristic is a `state` (as opposed to a `trait`) then time is
  used in the query for memory retrieval and the instruction for summarization.
  When the characteristic is a `trait` then time is not used.

  When you pass a `state_clock` while creating a characteristic then you create
  a `state` characteristic. When you do not pass a `state_clock` then you create
  a `trait` characteristic.
