  """Saves an agent to JSON data.

  This function saves the agent's state to a JSON string, which can be loaded
  afterwards with `rebuild_from_json`. The JSON data
  includes the state of the agent's context components, act component, memory,
  agent name and the initial config. The clock, model and embedder are not
  saved and will have to be provided when the agent is rebuilt. The agent must
  be in the `READY` phase to be saved.

  Args:
    agent: The agent to save.

  Returns:
    A JSON string representing the agent's state.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If the agent is not in the READY phase.
