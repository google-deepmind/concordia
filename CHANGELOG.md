## [1.8.4] - 2024-10-19

### Changed

- Allow conversation game master to be configured with memory and additional components
- Prevent daily_activities component from adding irrelevant info to memory and improve some of the time_and_place setting prompts.
- Add deprecation warning to the Sequential component
- together and mistral language model wrappers to no longer delete after last ".".
- Improve together.ai language model wrapper.
- disable pytype on a kwargs unpack
- Forward device and api_key only when explicitly specified.

- Add agreement tracker contrib component.
- Add state_formation environment
- Add basic_agent_without_plan and use it in a scenario for state_formation.

### Fixed

- Fixes a bug in inventory and schelling payoffs components, which previously crashed if player_action_attempt had ': ' in its text.


## [1.8.3] - 2024-10-08

### Changed

- Jitter sleep times in together ai wrapper. This may improve speed.
- Change AllSimilarMemories component so that it no longer weights retrieval by recency or importance. This will make it function more like its name suggests it should. Note that many agents use this component so their behavior may change as a result of this change.
- make default observations summary time frame be 24h
- Add seed parameter to all simulations, propagating it into sample_parameters

### Fixed

- Fix together AI api


## [1.8.2] - 2024-10-01

### Changed

- Improves logging of strings with newlines

### Fixed

- Insure concurrent execution of zero tasks returns immediately.
- Multi-item haggling environment, where players pick not only the price, but also the item to trade.


## [1.8.1] - 2024-09-20

### Added

- A wrapper that allows to limit the number of calls made by an LLM before it turns into a noop model

### Fixed

- Make Inventory component thread safe.


## [1.8.0] - 2024-09-17

### Changed

- Replace deprecated reference to langchain.llms with langchain_community.llms
- Improve logging in game master trigger components.
- Correct docstrings in base component type.
- Improve info printed on error in the together_ai model wrapper.
- Rename contrib agent components: contrib.components.agent.v2 -> contrib.components.agent.
- deprecate older contrib agent components
- Reformat reporting of subcomponents in all components derived from question of recent memory. We previously prefixed all subcomponents with "{name}'s\n" since typical names were things like "hunger" or "self identity". But it no longer makes sense given the way usage has evolved. Now we typically use subcomponents with keys like "Question: Is Bob hungry?\nAnswer: ". So the prefix should change.
- Make it optional to include full episode summaries in HTML logs and turn it off for the contest environments. The default preserves the old behavior.
- Improve Gemma2 wrapper: avoid lists, especially "\n\n" delimited lists.
- Improve clarity of GameMaster and fix type annotations
- Fix a few more issues in together.ai wrapper and improve filename handling in eval script.
- remove unused `concurrent_action` functionality
- Delete outdated base class and hide private methods
- Improve error handling, mid-sentence cutoffs, and max_tokens limit in Gemma2 model wrapper.
- Make formative memories warning less scary to participants.
- Print less warnings from mistral wrapper when they do not indicate a real problem
- add together_ai to utils
- Use concurrency helpers and hide executor implementation
- Add a maximum number of steps to the conversation scene. Default is 3
- Improve reality_show action/reward observations, parameterize more of its settings, and add scenarios.
- remove unused dependency
- Print recoverable exceptions in mistral model wrapper.

### Added

- Bots now support more complex fixed rule policies.
- Add an option to prevent the inventory component from ever increasing amounts of items in inventories (off by default, preserving the old behavior). This change also adds default context for the inventory reasoning chain of thought.
- Add an agent with a very simple prompting strategy, just observe and recall relevant memories. Nothing else.
- Add paranoid supporting agent and a substrate that uses it.
- Add test for supporting agent factories and add paranoid agent to the main role factories test. Also give basic_puppet_agent a default fixed_response (no fixed responses) for testing with no parameters.
- Add Together AI language model to Concordia. This can serve Gemma 2 9B
- Add additional concurrency helpers `run_tasks` and `run_tasks_in_background`
- allow colab users to pass an api key explicitly.

### Fixed

- Avoid pylint error by using direct import
- Fix pytype error
- Add lock to prevent duplicated _make_pre_act_value calls
- Hold lock on memory read to prevent reading during a write.
- Fix a bug which can arise when a model does not precisely follow the requested format in AccountForAgencyOfOthers.
- Add locking and check phase transitions
- The previous change didn't fully suppress harmless mistral exceptions, this one fixes it.
- Ensure run_parallel uses >1 worker
- Fix silent failures by checking futures after completion
- Fix language model setup util

### Changed

- rename the agent factories for clarity
- rename old basic_agent into deprecated_agent, as we are moving towards only using the entity_agent

## [1.6.0] - 2024-06-11

### Changed

- Reorganize modular launch files to better separate agent and environment concerns from each other, start reporting scores from all modular environments (printing them at the end of the run). Also, add a notebook to illustrate the new way of modularizing things. Also, various small improvements to all three modular environments, and use concurrency with better error handling in more places.
- Remove max_characters parameter on language model wrappers. It previously had
different semantics from model to model, so it would have produced bugs if
anyone was relying on it. It's better to remove it entirely since it's not needed.

- Make maximum conversation length configurable
- Make verbosity of conversation tracker configurable
- Only shutdown without waiting on error (better concurrent error handling)

### Added

- Add default importance function to associative memory (previous required).
- Improve the ollama model wrapper and refactor choice sampling for all LLMs.
- Allow the self perception component to have subcomponents.

- Add agent contrib component: `illness_representation` component.


### Fixed

- Fix bug which would have occurred in the case where the user produces a
conversation by repeatedly calling `agent.say` outside a conversation scene.
Previously the agent would not observe the conversation in that case since the
usual way of observing the conversation happens in the conversation scene, which
this approach bypasses.
- Fix bug which would cause a crash if no importance is passed in to memory.
- Fix bug in Schelling diagram payoffs component and refactor it.
- Fix bug in the Schedule component that adds 'None.' to memory when no events
are scheduled on a given step.

### Added

- Add aistudio model, remove deprecated cloud model, and rename vertex model.
- Add a debug language model that always returns empty strings and choice 0.

- fix typo


## [1.3.0] - 2024-05-4

### Changed

- Improve initialization of self perception component.
- Add configurable call_to_speech in conversation scene
- Change observation components to retrieve only observations from memory, filtering away memories produced by other components.

- Add clock to the plan component. It makes more sense when re-planning to know the time. Also, enables doing only one update per step
- Make sure components update only once per time step. Now that updates are recursively called on sub-components this makes a significant saving in API calls.
- Improve formative memories factory. Make more plausible memories.
- Make action_spec configurable per step
- Improve precision in the Inventory component.
- GM step function can optionally specify specific players to act this round.

- Add example result obtained from running the three_key_questions colab.
- Add agent component to select all relevant memories
